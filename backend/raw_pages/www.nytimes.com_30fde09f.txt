Israel’s military kept up its strikes on two fronts Monday, with an intense barrage on southern Lebanon and a retaliatory attack targeting Hamas in southern Gaza, a sign of how significantly the fighting has spread in the year since Hamas’s cross-border assault.

As Israelis commemorated [the Oct. 7 attack](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/06/world/israel-hamas-october-7-gaza-war) that led to the war in the Gaza Strip, Hamas launched a rare rocket attack at Tel Aviv, saying it was targeting “the depths of the occupation.” The rocket strike did little damage, and hours later, Israel responded with what it said was an attack on the rocket launcher that had fired the projectiles.

Israel also sent more troops to Lebanon to support the ground invasion there that it began last week with the stated goal of stopping the militant group Hezbollah from firing rockets across the border.

And on a separate front, the military said it had intercepted a missile fired at Israel by the Houthi militia, which is based in Yemen, about 1,000 miles away.

The scope of that military activity against the groups — all of them backed by Iran — made clear how the fighting has broadened a year after [Hamas led the attack](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/06/world/israel-hamas-october-7-gaza-war) on Israel. About 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage that day.
