Airdrops are not known for their precision.

On Thursday, after sweeping over the devastated landscape that is now Gaza, a Jordanian Air Force plane descended and banked. Following a brief countdown, its rear doors opened and, with two crew members tethered at the edge, pallets of food were dispatched to an uncertain fate.

The method is [notoriously unreliable](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/world/middleeast/gaza-airdrops.html), the amount of food insufficient, but Gazans are starving, and so after a hiatus of months, Jordan is one of several countries that have resumed the drops in recent days.
