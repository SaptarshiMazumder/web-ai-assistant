If you use a Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Exchange account with Outlook, you can use the Scheduling Assistant and Room Finder to help schedule your meetings.

**Note:**The new Room Finder was first available in Outlook for Microsoft 365 starting in Version 2012 (Build 13530.20316). Room Finder has a dependency on WebView2, which started rolling out to Microsoft 365 applications on April 1, 2021, version 2101 (Build 13628.20274) and higher. For more information on WebView2, see the admin documentation: [Microsoft Edge WebView2 and Microsoft 365 Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/webview2-install).

1. In a new meeting, add the **Required** attendees, the **Start time** and the **End time**, then select the **Room Finder** button at the end of the **Location** field.  
     
   Alternatively, you can select in the **Location** field and select **Browse with Room Finder** at the bottom in the list of suggested locations.   
     
    ![Image of drop down menu for room finder under location button.](/images/en-us/d6e0a6a9-09be-473c-ae2e-89cd877ab54c)
