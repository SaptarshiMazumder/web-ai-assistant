The Israeli government and President Trump’s Middle East envoy said on Thursday that they were recalling the teams that had been negotiating on a Gaza cease-fire with Hamas, perhaps imperiling the hope for the return of some of the last surviving Israeli hostages and relief for besieged Palestinians.

Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy, said in a statement that the latest response to an offer of a deal from Hamas’s surviving leadership showed “a lack of desire to reach a cease-fire in Gaza.” He added that “we will now consider alternative options to bring the hostages home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza,” without specifying what those alternatives might include.

But Israeli officials struck a different tone, saying the recall of the negotiators did not mean an end to the talks. In Jerusalem, three officials with knowledge of the negotiations said that there was no breakdown or collapse but that the delegation returned to discuss details ahead of further talks.
