### Start a live transcription

When you [record a meeting](/en-us/office/record-a-meeting-in-microsoft-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24), transcription starts automatically.

To start a live transcription only:

1. Select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c) in your meeting controls.

​​​​​​​All participants see a notification that the meeting is being transcribed. Participants can choose to [hide their identities in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).

Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### Change transcription language

To ensure transcription accuracy, make sure the meeting spoken language reflects the language everyone is speaking.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.
