Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the [meeting option entry points](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/meeting-options-in-microsoft-teams-53261366-dbd5-45f9-aae9-a70e6354f88e#bkmk_change_meeting_options).

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.
