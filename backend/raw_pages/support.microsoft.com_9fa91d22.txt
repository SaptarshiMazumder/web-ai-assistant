You can give someone in your organization permission to manage your Outlook calendar by granting them edit or delegate access.

When you assign edit permissions, the person you're sharing has the ability to view and make changes to your calendar. People you grant delegate access to, can also edit your calendar items, but in addition to that, they can also schedule and respond to meetings on your behalf.

If you want to provide access to your calendar, but not allow anyone to make changes, see [Share an Outlook calendar with other people](/en-us/office/share-an-outlook-calendar-as-view-only-with-others-353ed2c1-3ec5-449d-8c73-6931a0adab88).

**Note:**Delegate access is only available if you're using a work or school account in Microsoft 365 or with Exchange Online.

Select a tab option below for the version of Outlook you're using. [What version of Outlook do I have?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c)

**Note:**If the steps under this **New Outlook** tab don't work, you may not be using new Outlook yet. Select the **[Classic Outlook](#picktab=classic_outlook)** tab and follow those steps instead.

In new Outlook you can grant anyone within your organization editor or delegate access to your calendar.

**What's the difference between edit permissions and delegate permissions?**

* Editors can be assigned to your primary calendar (named "Calendar") or to any additional calendars that you created.
* Delegates can only be assigned to your primary calendar. Delegates can schedule and respond to meetings on your behalf.

**Note:**You can't give editor or delegate access to people outside your organization.

### Assign edit permissions only

1. In new Outlook from the navigation pane, select **Calendar**.
2. From the **Home** tab, select **Share Calendar**.
3. In the **Sharing and permissions** page, type the name or email address of the person you want to share your calendar with. Though you can share your calendar with more than one person, you can only add one person at a time.
4. After you've added the person you want to manage your calendar, select the drop-down list next to their name, and choose the level of access you want them to have.
5. Select **Can edit** to give them permission to make changes to your calendar.

   * The options **Can view when I'm busy**, **Can view titles and locations**, and **Can view all details** allow others to view your calendar but not make changes to it. Access for people from outside your organization is limited to these options.

### Assign delegate permissions

Delegates can not only edit your calendar, but they can also schedule and respond to meetings **on your behalf**.

1. In the new Outlook navigation pane, select **Calendar**.
2. From the **Home** tab, select **Share Calendar**.
3. In the **Sharing and permissions** page, type the name or email address of the person you want to share your calendar with and assign delegate access. Though you can share your calendar with more than one person, you can only add one person at a time from Outlook on the web.
4. After you've added the person you want to manage your calendar, select the drop-down list next to their name, and choose the level of access you want them to have.

   * Select **Delegate** to give them the same permission as an editor, plus they will receive meeting requests and responses on your behalf. To allow the delegate to see events on your calendar you marked Private, select the checkbox for **Let delegate view private events**. To allow the delegate to manage your categories, select the checkbox for **Let delegate manage categories**.

     ![Delegate category management sharing and permissions window](/images/en-us/1064c2e8-3f0e-4d28-9060-8bb711c3424f)

     **Note:**Calendar items marked **Private** are protected. Most people you share your calendar with see only the time of items marked **Private**, not the subject, location, or other details. The exception to this is if you select the **Let delegate view private events** check box.
5. After you've finished adding the person you want to share your calendar with and have chosen which permission you want to give them, select **Share**. If you decide not to share your calendar right now, select ![Remove](/images/en-us/407ca4b4-3687-408f-b485-0ba3662a8f76)**Remove**.

   The person you shared your calendar with will receive an email message telling them about it. When they select the **Accept** button in the invitation, it will add your calendar to their list of calendars.
6. After you've given someone delegate access to your calendar, you'll see an additional option in **Sharing and permissions** that lets you control how meeting requests and responses are processed. If you have multiple delegates, you'll need to do this for each of your delegates.
7. Under **Delegates**, next to **Send invitations and responses to**, select one of the following options:

   * **Delegate only** Meeting requests and responses go only to your delegates.
   * **Delegate and send me a copy** Meeting requests and responses are sent to you and your delegates. Only your delegates see the option to accept or decline a meeting request, and the notification sent to you will appear like a normal email message. You can still respond to the meeting by opening the calendar item and responding.
   * **Both my delegate and me** Meeting requests and responses are sent both to you and your delegates. Either of you can respond to the meeting invitation.
8. If you decide not to share your calendar with someone, under Delegates select ![Remove](/images/en-us/407ca4b4-3687-408f-b485-0ba3662a8f76)**Remove** for the person you no longer want to act as a delegate.

### Stop sharing a calendar

If you would like to stop sharing your calendar with someone, use Outlook on the web to remove his or her permissions.

1. In new Outlook from the navigation pane, select **Calendar**.
2. From the **Home** tab, select **Share Calendar**.

   By default, your primary calendar is called "Calendar". If you created other calendars, you can select one of them instead. You cannot remove sharing permissions from calendars owned by other people.
3. Select ![Remove](/images/en-us/407ca4b4-3687-408f-b485-0ba3662a8f76)**Remove** next to the person with whom you want to stop sharing your calendar.

   The person is now removed from the list of people with access to your calendar. If the person is inside your organization, your calendar will be removed from their list of calendars. If the person is outside your organization, their copy of your calendar isn't removed but will no longer sync to your calendar or receive updates.

### Make someone my delegate in classic Outlook

A delegate automatically receives Send on Behalf permissions. By default, the delegate can read only your meeting requests and responses. The delegate isn't granted permission to read other messages in your **Inbox**.

1. In classic Outlook, select the **File** tab, then select **Account Settings** > **Delegate Access**.
2. In the dialog, select **Add**.

   If **Add** doesn't appear, an active connection might not exist between Outlook and Exchange. The Outlook status bar displays the connection status.
3. Type the name of the person whom you want to designate as your delegate, or search for and then select the name in the search results list.

   **Note:**The delegate must be a person in your organization's Exchange Global Address List (GAL).
4. Select **Add**, then select **OK**.
5. In the **Delegate Permissions** dialog box, accept the default permission settings or select custom access levels for Exchange folders.

   If a delegate needs permission to work only with meeting requests and responses, the default permission settings, such as **Delegate receives copies of meeting-related messages sent to me**, are sufficient. You can leave the **Inbox** permission setting at **None**. Meeting requests and responses will go directly to the delegate's **Inbox**.

   **Note:**By default, the delegate is granted **Editor (can read, create, and modify items)** permission to your **Calendar** folder. When the delegate responds to a meeting on your behalf, it is automatically added to your **Calendar** folder.
6. To send a message to notify the delegate of the changed permissions, select the **Automatically send a message to delegate summarizing these permissions** check box.
7. If you want, select the **Delegate can see my private items** check box.

   **Important:**This setting affects all Exchange folders. This includes all Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, and Journal folders. There is no way to grant access to private items in only specified folders.
8. Select **OK**.

   **Notes:**

   * Messages sent with Send on Behalf permissions include both the delegate's and your names next to **From**. When a message is sent with Send As permissions, only your name appears.
   * Once you add someone as a delegate, they can add your Exchange mailbox to their Outlook profile. For instructions, see [Manage another person's mail and calendar items](/en-us/office/allow-messages-to-be-sent-on-your-behalf-when-sharing-a-folder-or-mailbox-afb79d6b-2967-43b9-a944-a6b953190af5).

### Change permissions for a delegate

1. In classic Outlook, select the **File** tab, then select **Account Settings** > **Delegate Access**.
2. Select the name of the delegate for whom you want to change permissions, and then select **Permissions**.

   **Note:**If you want to remove all Delegate Access permissions, don't select **Permissions** but instead select **Remove** and skip the rest of these steps.
3. Change the permissions for any Outlook folder that the delegate has access to.
4. To send a message to notify the delegate of the changed permissions, select the **Automatically send a message to delegate summarizing these permissions** check box.

**Note:**If you want copies of meeting requests and responses that you receive to be sent to a delegate, ensure that the delegate is assigned **Editor (can read, create, and modify items)** permission to your **Calendar** folder, and then select the **Delegate receives copies of meeting-related messages sent to me** check box.

### Change delegate access to private items

If you have assigned permissions to a delegate so they can access your Outlook folders, you can hide personal information in appointments, meetings, tasks, and contacts. Open each personal item, and in the **Tags** group, select **Private**.

To grant access to your private items, do the following:

1. In classic Outlook, select the **File** tab, then select **Account Settings** > **Delegate Access**.
2. Select the name of the delegate for whom you want to change access to your private appointments, and then select **Permissions**.
3. Select the **Delegate can see my private items** check box.

**Important:**You shouldn't rely on the Private feature to prevent other people from accessing the details of your appointments, contacts, or tasks. To ensure that other people can't read the items that you marked as private, don't grant them **Reviewer (can read items)** permission to your **Calendar**, **Contacts**, or **Tasks** folder.

[Top of Page](/en-us/office/about-delegates-allow-someone-to-manage-your-mail-and-calendar-in-outlook-41c40c04-3bd1-4d22-963a-28eafec25926#top)

You can give anyone within your organization editor or delegate access to your calendar.
