Keep your meetings organized and effective with meeting notes. Add an agenda, notes, and tasks for others to see and edit directly in Teams. Once added, meeting notes can also be shared and edited in Office.com with a Loop document.

People who aren’t directly invited to a meeting might have limited access to its meeting notes. For the best experience, edit notes before or after a meeting from your Teams Calendar or the web browser.

**Note:**External attendees won't be able to access or edit meeting notes.
