3. In the **Sharing and permissions** page, type the name or email address of the person you want to share your calendar with and assign delegate access. Though you can share your calendar with more than one person, you can only add one person at a time from Outlook on the web.
4. After you’ve added the person you want to manage your calendar, select the drop-down list next to their name, and choose the level of access you want them to have.
5. Select **Delegate** to give them the same permission as an editor, plus they will receive meeting requests and responses on your behalf.

   ![Check the box next to Let delegate manage categories](/images/en-us/cec8de16-e555-474e-af17-3412f9229ab7)

After you’ve finished adding the person you want to share your calendar with and have chosen which permission you want to give them, select **Share**. If you decide not to share your calendar right now, select **Remove**.

The person you shared your calendar with will receive an email message telling them about it. When they select the **Accept** button in the invitation, it will add your calendar to their list of calendars.

## Manage and use executive's categories as a delegate

If you have been granted category management permission, you must accept the permissions and restart Outlook to manage the list of your executive's categories in **Settings**.

You can now create new categories on behalf of your executive who granted the permission. You can also apply these categories to the Mail and Calendar events of the executive.

### View and create categories for an executive:

1. Go to Outlook **Settings**.
2. Select **Accounts** > **Categories**.
3. Select the executive's account from the drop-down list to view their categories.
4. From here you can **Create new** categories.

### Apply categories to Calendar meetings and events:

1. In Outlook, go to **Calendar**.
2. Expand the section called **People’s calendars**  and select your executive's calendar.
3. Select and hold (or right-click) one of their meetings or events, and then select **Categorize**
4. To add an existing category, select it from the list, or choose **New category**. Enter a name for the new category and choose a color.
5. Select **Save**.

**Notes:**

* You can only create categories on behalf of someone else at this time. The ability to edit, favorite or delete existing categories on behalf of someone else is not yet supported.
* Additionally, it may take up to 30 minutes for the new category to be reflected in the other person's calendar.

### Here are some calendar tips and mail tips to help executive assistants and delegates better navigate their time management needs in new Outlook.​​​​​​​

## Calendar tips

**Find time and request in-person event**

When scheduling a meeting, click on **Find a time** to easily find suitable time slots on the attendee's calendars. You can view availability by hovering on the attendee icon.

You can also request in-person attendance by turning on the **In-person event** toggle on. You can still add a Teams meeting link for attendees who may not be able to join in person.

[Schedule in-person events in Outlook](/en-us/office/schedule-in-person-events-in-outlook-956ae899-096e-419d-b812-a515d0710611)

![screenshot shows find a time option when scheduling a meeting in new Outlook](/images/en-us/4c124b52-03d5-4368-b8bb-260062d77b7a)

![Screenshot shows In-person event toggle on in new Outlook](/images/en-us/3183105b-462f-4d43-bf81-3ec872565b62)

**Use Scheduling Assistant**

Use the scheduling assistant to easily find time for meetings. In new Outlook, you can view the attendee time zones and schedule labels in the Scheduling Assistant.  
Note that attendee time zones are shown only if at least one attendee is in a different time zone.

[Use the Scheduling Assistant to help schedule your meetings](/en-us/office/use-the-scheduling-assistant-and-room-finder-for-meetings-in-outlook-2e00ac07-cef1-47c8-9b99-77372434d3fa)

![Screenshot shows scheduling assistant in new Outlook to find time for meetings](/images/en-us/93f0cfe6-5592-4afc-bc47-77c90e55bd68)

**Automatic online meetings**

In new Outlook, all meetings are online by default. The Teams meeting toggle is turned on when you add attendees to a meeting. Unlike classic Outlook, the Teams meeting link and details are added after the invite is sent. You can then view the meeting invite to see and copy the Teams meeting details.  
We are working to update this behavior and pre-create meeting links so you will see the experience match classic Outlook in the future.

**Note:**You can update every meeting online setting from **Settings***>*** Calendar **>** Events** and invitations and enable or disable **Add online meeting to all meetings**.

If you are using 3rd party online meeting providers like Zoom or Cisco WebEx, you will also see those as meeting provider options in this setting, provided you have their web add-in installed.

[Make every meeting online](/en-us/office/make-every-meeting-online-70f9bda0-fd29-498b-9757-6709cc1c73f0)

![Screenshot shows meeting provider options for 3rd party online meeting providers](/images/en-us/3cd0cca6-2ada-4198-9f72-f2443784dbf5)

**Hide attendee list**

You can now choose to hide the attendee list from being visible to users who receive the meeting invite. When creating a new meeting, select **Response options** and click on **Hide attendee list**

![Screenshot showing hide attendee list](/images/en-us/11c98a08-e551-4f52-8e9d-2721b0e04c17)

**Attendees can add rooms**

In new Outlook, attendees can add rooms by forwarding the meeting invite to the relevant rooms. The meeting room will then be visible to all attendees.

![Screenshot showing attendees can add rooms in new Outlook](/images/en-us/1b51f8d7-261c-4af9-aa73-7e7262ab7cbd)

**Edit events in a series**

New Outlook for Windows offers the following options for editing a meeting series:

1. This event: Updates only the selected instance of the meeting series.
2. This and all following events: Updates the selected instance and all future occurrences in the series, leaving past instances unchanged. (This option is not available in classic Outlook for Windows.)
3. All events in the series: Updates every instance in the meeting series.

![Screenshot showing edit events in series](/images/en-us/3f1cdc3a-b9d1-4875-83bf-3ef5d7c8940c)

**Duplicate a meeting**

Right click on an event in the calendar surface and select **Duplicate event** to duplicate it.

![Screenshot showing duplicate event in calendar in new Outlook](/images/en-us/259d63de-d0d4-495a-92ab-9261e833ab82)

**Add multiple Time Zones in calendar**

Easily manage meetings across different time zones in New Outlook. New Outlook allows you to add up to 20 time zones in the calendar, whereas classic Outlook allows adding only 3 time zones.

[Manage time zone settings in Outlook](/en-us/office/manage-time-zone-settings-in-outlook-65239869-12e7-4a9d-bca1-76b0ad7ce273)

![Screenshot showing adding multiple time zone in calendar](/images/en-us/821c5981-6c37-4a71-a33a-ac16d74d54c5)

**Use executive's categories in calendar**

Select and hold (or right-click) an event in the calendar view and select **Categorize** to apply an executive's categories. We plan to allow executive admins to edit, favorite, and delete executive's categories in the future.

[Use calendar categories and reminders in Outlook](/en-us/office/use-calendar-categories-and-reminders-in-outlook-59230c47-6fe9-46bd-8646-e1118e9eb973)

![Screenshots showing executive categories in calendar space in new Outlook](/images/en-us/78dede9e-f75a-43e5-b7c4-0d77a821baed)

**Receive shared calendar notifications**

In new Outlook, users can opt to receive notifications on changes to events in the shared calendar. This capability is extended to both the executive principal and delegates.

You can select the calendars you want to opt in for notifications from **Settings**>** Calendar > Shared Calendars> Calendar updates**.

[Receive notifications from a shared calendar in Outlook](/en-us/office/receive-notifications-from-a-shared-calendar-in-outlook-f6a318d6-9d76-4c9f-b8c0-9c6f94066eb0)

![Screenshot showing users to opt calendar notifications](/images/en-us/a2a267e4-b6e1-4a34-83bd-5416e70dc9ab)

**Don't send response RSVP tracked**

In classic Outlook, if the user chooses **Do not send response** while RSVPing, the organizer will not be able to track that individual RSVP.

However, in new Outlook, if the user unchecks **Email organizer** while RSVPing, even though there will not be a visible response email sent to the organizer, the organizer will still be able track that RSVP as long as the organizer and the RSVPing attendee are in the same M365 tenant (or organization).  
  
We plan to support RSVP tracking across different tenants in the future.

![Screenshot shows don't send response RSVP tracked in new outlook](/images/en-us/1ce1ab6f-14d1-4b32-97c7-11b06725141a)

**Preserve declined meetings on the calendar and RSVP'd meetings in inbox**

Preserve declined meetings on the calendar so that you can still be aware of it and update RSVP later if needed. This can be enabled by selecting **Settings** > **Calendar** > **Events and invitations**  and clicking the **Save declined events** checkbox.

Meetings that have been RSVP'd to, can also be retained in the inbox so that you can easily find them later. This can be done from **Settings** > **Calendar** > **Events and invitations** > **Invitations** from other people and selecting the **Delete invitations from inbox after responding**.  
These settings will have to be enabled on the executive's mailbox for them to be respected in the delegate calendar and inbox folder respectively.

[Show a declined meeting on my calendar](/en-us/office/show-a-declined-meeting-on-my-calendar-in-outlook-24e81b9b-3906-4c02-8b63-f97b02161763)

![Screenshot showing preserve declined meetings on the calendar](/images/en-us/b28e71b7-c32a-4a7a-84f6-c13c892c0556)

**Follow a meeting you can't attend**

The new RSVP option allows you to let the organizer know you can't attend but want to be kept informed. You will continue to have access to the meeting chat and any recording and meeting notes if they are available. his is a great way to stay informed about discussions that you or your executives are unable to join.

[Follow a meeting in Outlook](/en-us/office/follow-a-meeting-in-outlook-4dd196ec-b4ae-4fca-9577-cb9c297723be)

![Screenshot of follow a meeting you can't attend](/images/en-us/9c823203-2beb-4498-b966-bfad7db23ca5)​​​​​​​

**RSVP in-person or virtually**

When you want to know how many people will attend an event in person or virtually, create an in-person event by turning on the **In-Person event** toggle next to the location field. Although you are marking the event as "in-person," you can also add a Teams meeting for those who are not able to make it into the office and still want to participate.

Recipients will now see the RSVP options for **Yes, in-person**, **Yes, virtually** and **Yes** with no attendance information.

![Turn the In-person event toggle on to display to recipients the meeting is happening in person.](/images/en-us/894d3284-89ca-466a-bbc0-6ac73052e85a)​​​​​​​

You can now send meeting updates **only to the added/removed attendees** instead of everyone on the recipients list.
