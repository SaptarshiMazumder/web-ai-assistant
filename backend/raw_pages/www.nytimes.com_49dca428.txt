Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Wednesday that the military and security forces had recovered the remains of two Israeli hostages held in Gaza since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack that ignited the war.

“The bodies of two of our hostages were returned to Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement, adding that only one of their names, Yair Yaakov, had been cleared for publication.

Mr. Netanyahu said Mr. Yaakov had been “murdered and abducted” by the militant group Islamic Jihad in the 2023 attack. “Together with all citizens of Israel, my wife and I extend our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearest loved ones,” he added.

The Israeli military said in a statement on Wednesday about the other hostage: “His family has been notified and his name will be cleared for release later.”

Mr. Yaakov had been a member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a farming community near the border with Gaza that was hit hard by the assault. He was 59 when he was killed, according to a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of some captives.

He was taken from his home along with his children, Or and Yagil, and his partner, Meirav, according to the forum, and his death was confirmed in February 2024. The other family members were released as part of a temporary cease-fire deal in November 2023.
