## FAQ

### Why is my meeting recording automatically if I didn’t schedule it that way?

* If you schedule a meeting or event using the town hall or webinar template, automatic recording and transcription will be on by default.   
    
  To turn off automatic recording before the meeting or event starts, open the event details in your Teams calendar and select **Meeting options**  ![Settings icon](/images/en-us/e2a1f329-d95b-7d5e-181c-7c3e12fd9321) > **Recording & transcription** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e). Then, turn the **Record and transcribe automatically** toggle off.   
    
  To learn more, see [Manage webinar recordings](/en-us/office/manage-webinar-recordings-in-microsoft-teams-8cf1ba61-c9d8-4628-8b5d-0dcdb8503144) or [Manage town hall recordings](/en-us/office/manage-town-hall-recordings-in-microsoft-teams-88ac3af7-db67-4556-a202-b73a1d6c2e46).

### Where is my recording?

If you can’t find a recording:

* Check if there is a message indicating that your recording started. If you don’t see this message, the recording most likely didn’t start and can’t be recovered.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a recording start notification.](/images/en-us/dc21305a-252b-4f92-8b1a-e733b250e474)
* If you know the recording was started but can’t find it in OneDrive, check if it was deleted, moved to a different location, or expired. Look in your recycle bin and second stage recycle bin.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a file recycle bin highlighting where to find the second stage recycle bin.](/images/en-us/90900c77-8b4c-4c28-a09c-5538d6301610)
* If you can’t find your recording in OneDrive but see this recording chiclet in your chat history, your recording failed to upload to OneDrive and will be stored in a temporary storage for 21 days. You can retry uploading it to OneDrive or download it to your local device.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a recording chiclet that indicated the recording upload failed.](/images/en-us/e2fbb734-95a5-464a-9a35-a3afd9245f14)
