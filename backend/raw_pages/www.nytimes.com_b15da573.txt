Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s envoy for peace missions, went to the Gaza Strip on Friday and visited an aid distribution site as a hunger crisis in the territory deepens.

Hundreds of [Palestinians have been killed](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/20/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-military-evacuation.html) in the past two months in Gaza while trying to secure aid, which has led to growing international pressure on Israel to ease the humanitarian situation.

Mr. Witkoff [posted a photograph](https://x.com/SEPeaceMissions/status/1951270165519212969) on social media of himself and Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, at an aid site overseen by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or G.H.F. The much-criticized, Israel-backed group run by American security contractors has taken over a large part of the aid distribution system in Gaza since May.

“We spent over five hours inside Gaza — level setting the facts on the ground, assessing conditions, and meeting with @GHFUpdates and other agencies,” Mr. Witkoff said in a X post. “The purpose of the visit was to give @POTUS a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza.”

In [his own social media post](https://x.com/USAmbIsrael/status/1951238042078843160), Mr. Huckabee said that he and Mr. Witkoff had been briefed by the Israeli military and “spoke to folks on the ground.” It was not immediately clear whom he meant.

Mr. Witkoff was wearing a black “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” hat and a blue flak jacket in photographs included in the post.
