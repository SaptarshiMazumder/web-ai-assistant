For months, the Israeli government had focused on negotiating a two-phased deal for a 60-day cease-fire in Gaza and the release of some hostages, leaving discussions about a permanent end to the war for a later stage.

With the talks now at an impasse, American and Israeli officials appear to be sharply changing their tone by signaling that they will push for a comprehensive deal. But Israel and Hamas remain far apart, and analysts said this new approach would also face steep challenges.

The shift, at least in rhetoric, comes as the Israeli government faces [rising domestic pressure](https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000010320633/tel-aviv-protest-following-hamas-hostage-videos.html) to secure the release of hostages still held in Gaza. Israel believes that about 20 are still alive and that the bodies of 30 others remain in the enclave. Videos released over the weekend showed two living captives [looking emaciated and frail](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/02/world/europe/new-hostage-videos-sow-fear-and-horror-in-israel.html), shocking many Israelis and sparking fear among the hostages’ families.

The Israeli government has also come under [mounting international criticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/world/middleeast/gaza-starvation-aid-israel-netanyahu.html) over the [mass hunger that has spread through Gaza](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/world/middleeast/gaza-starvation.html)’s population of about two million people after Israel imposed strict restrictions in recent months on the entry of aid.

Israel has continued launching military strikes on Gaza, even as it has facilitated the entry of more aid into Gaza in recent days. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said on Sunday that Israeli artillery had hit its offices in Khan Younis, killing one of the aid group’s staffers and injuring others. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.

Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s special envoy to the Middle East, who is [visiting the region](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/world/middleeast/witkoff-gaza-aid-trump-us.html), met with families of Israeli hostages on Saturday and told them that President Trump now wants to see all the living hostages released at once.
