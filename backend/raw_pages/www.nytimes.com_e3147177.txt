Famine is unfolding across most of Gaza, a U.N.-backed food security group said this week, citing months of severe aid restrictions imposed by Israel on the territory.

“The worst-case scenario of famine is playing out in Gaza,” the group, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or I.P.C., [said in a statement](https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_GazaStrip_Alert_July2025.pdf). The I.P.C. is an initiative backed by the United Nations, aid agencies and governments.

“Mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths,” the group added, noting that one in three people in Gaza are going without food for days at a time.
