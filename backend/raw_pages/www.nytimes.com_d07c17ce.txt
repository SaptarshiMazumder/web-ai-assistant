Most countries in the United Nations — 147 out of 193 — already recognize a Palestinian state, which currently has observer status at the U.N.

Then, in the course of just the past week, three more countries — all major U.S. allies — said they would join their ranks.

First, [France](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/world/europe/france-palestine-statehood-macron-gaza.html) said it would recognize a Palestinian state in September, and in the days that followed, [Britain](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/world/europe/uk-palestine-state-starmer-gaza-israel.html) and [Canada](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/world/canada/canada-palestinian-state-recognition.html) announced that they, too, were prepared to follow suit. Britain said it would move forward if Israel did not agree to a cease-fire with Hamas in Gaza by September, while Canada tied a final decision to political changes by the Palestinian Authority.
