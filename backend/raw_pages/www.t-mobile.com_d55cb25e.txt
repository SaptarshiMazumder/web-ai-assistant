* ## Who is eligible for T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  Eligibility is determined by the home service address. Address eligibility is based off network capacity, which is always expanding, but can also change as more customers join T-Mobile. New and existing T-Mobile customers can check availability [here](https://www.t-mobile.com/home-internet?&cmpid=HEIS_PB_P_HMEINTRNET_43700080241009159_706011857228&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAl4a6BhBqEiwAqvrquhiadH_v4vFOBBWucoa3MHxP6VLc0my5gOfsTi0isHtPHSjMdURhtBoC9SQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).

  + Home Internet Lite must have a service address eligible for Lite plans. Home Internet Lite plans activated starting May 9, 2024 may only be used at the approved address and may be restricted away from the approved address.
  + AWAY™ customers must have an eligible physical address to get started. Once activated, AWAY™ plans may be used nationwide across T-Mobile's network, but should not be used primarily in a single location.
* ## Do these plans come with 5-Year price guarantee?

Taxes & fees, voluntary equipment or speed upgrades, future wireless generations, select limited-time promotions, per-use charges, third-party services, and network management practices aren't included.

* ## Can I get a discount for having both T-Mobile phone and Internet services?

  Yes, you can get a discount when you bundle T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, or T-Mobile All-In Internet with T-Mobile voice service. For more information on our plans and discounts, visit our Home Internet Plans page.
* ## Can I purchase higher-speed service?

  We don’t offer tiered pricing based on speeds at this time. Customers receive the best speeds available from the service at their location. As better speeds are available, customers will automatically experience them, at no additional cost. During congestion, Internet customers may notice speeds slower than customers using other T-Mobile services and further reduction if using >1.2TB/mo., due to data prioritization.
* ## Can I get T-Mobile 5G Internet for my business?

  Great news! T-Mobile has the Internet access solutions that you need to keep your business and employees connected and productive. Visit your T-Mobile store to find the best internet option for your business - <https://www.t-mobile.com/stores/locator>.
* ## Are there ways I cannot use T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  You can use your Home Internet for all your everyday activities such as homework, streaming and video conferencing! But to ensure that our network is available for all customers, there are some restrictions on activities that can damage or disproportionately congest the network. For example, Home Internet is not intended for unattended use, automatic data feeds, automated machine-to-machine connections, or uses that automatically consume unreasonable amounts of available network capacity. In addition, many T-Mobile Internet products are intended to be used in a fixed location and use at a location other than the one we’ve approved is not permitted and may be restricted. Please see [T-Mobile's Terms and Conditions](https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/policies/internet-service) for prohibited uses.
* ## Can I transfer my T-Mobile 5G Internet service when I move homes?

  Yes, give us a call at 1-877-373-0347 prior to moving to confirm that your new address is eligible for service and set up a change of address.

  T-Mobile 5G Home Internet is delivered via 5G cellular network and speeds vary due to factors affecting cellular networks.

It comes with 130GB of data a month - enough to keep a typical household connected with Wi-Fi for up to 7 days in case your primary internet service goes down.
* ## Who is eligible for Home Internet Backup?

  Home Internet Backup is for people with an existing primary internet provider who need a backup connectivity solution for when their primary internet provider has an outage or connectivity goes down.
* ## How do I use Home Internet Backup when my primary internet service provider has an outage?

  Home Internet Backup comes with a 5G Gateway included and takes just minutes to install. Keep your gateway plugged in and when your primary internet connection goes out, simply switch your devices over to your Home Internet Backup Wi-Fi connection to stay online until your primary provider is back up and running.
* ## What is included in the Home Internet Backup Plan?

  Home Internet Backup gives 130 GB of data – enough to keep a typical household connected for up to 7 days a month – and a 5G gateway included for $20 per month with AutoPay.
* ## What happens if I use all my Home Internet Backup full speed data?

  Once you use your 130 GB of monthly full speed data, you’ll stay connected at speeds of up to 600 kbps until your plan resets on the first day of your next billing cycle. Home Internet Backup is intended for use only as a backup in the event of a separate, primary internet provider outage.
* ## How do I monitor my data usage?

   Additionally, if you have a T-Mobile Voice line, you’ll also receive an SMS message letting you know how much data you’ve used for the month.

* ## When does my full speed data replenish?

  Your data will reset on the first day of your new billing cycle.
* ## What if the gateway is turned on, but no data is used?

  No problem! The gateway can stay plugged in and on, and data will only be used if devices are connected to the Home Internet Backup Wi-Fi, so check to make sure you have disconnected them until an outage occurs. Home Internet Backup is intended for use only as a backup in the event of a separate, primary internet provider outage.
* ## **How long will 130GB of data last?**

  It depends on several factors, including your household's usage behavior, the number of devices connected, and the type of activities you engage in online. However, 130GB of data is enough to keep a typical household connected for 7 days.
