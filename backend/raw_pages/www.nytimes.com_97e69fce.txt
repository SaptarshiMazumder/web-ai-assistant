Israel said it paused military activity in parts of Gaza on Sunday to allow in international aid, amid growing outrage over the severe hunger faced by Palestinians in the territory.

The decision was a reversal by Israel that followed growing pressure over the [dire conditions in Gaza](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/world/middleeast/gaza-starvation.html), where nearly one in three people has not been eating “for multiple days in a row,” according to the World Food Program, an arm of the United Nations.

Many countries, including some of Israel’s traditional allies, blame Israel for the widespread hunger crisis. The Israeli government blocked almost all aid to Gaza from March through May in an effort to squeeze concessions from Hamas, and has restricted aid deliveries into the territory since then.
