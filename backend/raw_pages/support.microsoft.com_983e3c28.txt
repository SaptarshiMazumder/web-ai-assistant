**Note:**Live captions and subtitles are only available for live events produced using Teams.

Use the **Translate to** menu to add up to six languages attendees can choose to see captions and subtitles in, in addition to the language being spoken. For example, if the spoken language is English, but you know there’s an office in the Netherlands tuning in, select **Dutch (Netherlands)** so they can get captions in Dutch.
