President Emmanuel Macron announced late Thursday that France would recognize the state of Palestine as part of “its historical commitment to a just and durable peace in the Middle East.”

In a surprise statement on X that followed months of hints and hesitations over possible French recognition of a Palestinian state, he said that he would make a formal announcement to that effect at the United Nations General Assembly in September in New York.

“Today the most urgent thing is that the war in Gaza cease and the civilian population be helped,” Mr. Macron said. His statement came as anger mounted across the world over the continued Israeli military operation in Gaza and [growing starvation there](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/world/middleeast/gaza-starvation.html).

France would become the first of the Group of 7 major industrialized nations — also including the United States, Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan and Italy — to recognize a Palestinian state. The decision appeared likely to irk the Trump administration as it stands behind Israel and pursues its own attempts to end the war in Gaza.

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, reacted angrily to the French move. He said in a statement that “we strongly condemn Mr. Macron’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state next to Tel Aviv in the wake of the Oct. 7 massacre” of 2023, adding that a Palestinian state could become “a launchpad to annihilate Israel.”

Israel has consistently opposed French recognition of Palestinian statehood, saying it would reward Hamas terrorism and accusing Mr. Macron of leading “a crusade against the Jewish state.” Relations between the two countries have become strained and now appear certain to worsen.
