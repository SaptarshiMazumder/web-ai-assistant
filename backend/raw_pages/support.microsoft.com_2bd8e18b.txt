Communicate clearly and efficiently during multilingual meetings and conferences with language interpretation in Microsoft Teams.

Language interpretation allows professional interpreters to convert what the speaker says into another language in real-time, without disrupting the speaker's original flow of delivery. This simultaneous interpretation will lead to more inclusive meetings, where participants who speak different languages can fully collaborate with each other.

**Notes:**

* Language interpretation is not currently available in [end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings](/en-us/office/use-end-to-end-encryption-for-teams-meetings-a8326d15-d187-49c4-ac99-14c17dbd617c).
* If you turn on [spatial audio](/en-us/office/spatial-audio-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-547b5f81-1825-4ee1-a1cf-f02e12db4fdb) in a meeting with live interpretation, you'll hear the original and translated audio at the same volume. Turn off spatial audio and rejoin the meeting to hear the interpreter's voice clearly with reduced original voice.

## Interpreter experience

Interpreters can hear all speakers and start interpreting immediately after they join a meeting. Once they join, they won't be able to switch rooms themselves.

Interpreters can also switch their translation direction during a Teams meeting by selecting the language they’re currently translating into at the bottom of the meeting window. The language they’re translating into will appear highlighted.

## FAQ

### Does Microsoft provide interpreters?

Microsoft does not provide interpreters. Organizations will need to hire their own interpreters to support their interpretation needs.

### Can interpreters join on web?

Language interpretation isn't currently supported for interpreters or attendees joining on Teams for web.

### What information does the interpreter have access to?

Interpreters will have the same permissions as attendees. They'll be able to see the meeting chat, meeting roster, etc.

### How many interpreters can I add to a meeting?

You can add up to 16 different language pairs (for example, translating French to Spanish counts as one language pair). You can assign as many interpreters to the 16 language pairs as needed.

Note: An interpreter can't be an organizer or co-organizer of the meeting.

### What types of meetings does this feature work with?

Language interpretation is supported for regular scheduled meetings, channel meetings, meetings with up to 1000 participants, and webinars.

Breakout rooms are not currently supported. In meetings with breakout rooms, the main meeting can be interpreted, but interpretation will stop when the breakout rooms start.

Language interpretation is not currently available in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings.

### Can I turn on captions for a meeting with interpretation?

Captions in a meeting with language interpretation will only caption the main speaker, not the interpreter. If the language of the main speaker changes, the meeting's organizer will need to switch the live captions' spoken language to the correct language for captioning to work.

### Will meeting recordings have both original and translated audio?

Meeting recordings in a meeting with language interpretation only capture the audio of the main channel, or original speaker. The interpreter's audio will not be present on the recording.

Compliance recording is not currently supported in meetings with language interpretation.

### What kind of set up do interpreters need?

Interpreters must join meetings on Teams for desktop. Language selection isn't available on Teams for web or mobile.
