Victims and relatives of people killed or injured in attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah have sued the United Nations agency dedicated to Palestinians, accusing it of aiding the armed groups and fueling terrorism.

The lawsuit was filed on Thursday [in federal court in the District of Columbia](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.283279/gov.uscourts.dcd.283279.1.0.pdf) by American citizens living in Israel and the United States and their family members. A similar case has been playing out since last year in federal court in Manhattan.

Both suits are attempting to hold the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, known as UNRWA, responsible in some measure for violent acts by Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, groups dedicated to the destruction of Israel that have been designated terrorist organizations by the United States. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages, both compensatory and punitive.
