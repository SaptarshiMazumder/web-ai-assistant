If you're unable to attend a meeting, you can select **Follow** as your response to help you stay informed of the meeting events. Following a meeting reminds the organizer to record the meeting and alert you to any follow-up items.

For meeting organizers, you'll receive email responses letting you know which of your attendees responded with **Follow**. See the section, [For the meeting organizer](#bkmk_mtgorganizer).

**Note:**If you're not seeing this feature, it's because it's currently in limited release. Check again soon. For more details see [When do I get the newest features for Microsoft 365?](/en-us/office/when-do-i-get-the-newest-features-for-microsoft-365-da36192c-58b9-4bc9-8d51-bb6eed468516)

### When attendees select to Follow a meeting

Attendees will only see the option to respond with **Follow** if a meeting has two or more participants and when the organizer has requested responses.

All responses, including Follow responses are visible to everyone. This is what happens to each group when attendees select to Follow a meeting:

### The organizer

**Receives the Follow response**   
This lets the organizer know an attendee can't attend the meeting, but they want to stay informed.

**Reminder to record the Teams meeting**
  
The organizer gets a reminder to record the meeting and take collaborative notes.

**Note:**To have the recording reminder appear, your admin must have set the recording policy in Teams.

### The attendee

**Has access to recording and transcripts**
  
The attendee can access the recording and meeting transcripts that were created for the meeting. For more details, see [Meeting Recap with Outlook](/en-us/office/meeting-recap-with-outlook-cd391f5b-7f41-4419-814d-2e5a81c3fbcb).

**Calendar shows the time as free**
  
Even though the attendee's calendar shows free, they'll still have access to the meeting and chat.

**Note:**Follow responses are only available in new Outlook for Windows and Outlook on the web. If the meeting organizer is using either of these versions of Outlook, they'll see your Follow response. However, if they're using classic Outlook on Windows, Outlook for Mac, or Outlook on Mobile, your meeting response will appear as Tentative.

### For the meeting organizer

If you're the meeting organizer, a Follow response lets you know that an attendee can't attend the meeting, but that they're following it and therefore want to receive information about the meeting including any recordings or transcripts available.

As the organizer, when you request responses and choose not to hide the attendee list, all Follow responses are also visible to other attendees.

At the beginning of your meeting, you'll be prompted to record it in Teams. All attendees, including those following the meeting will have access to the recording and any accompanying transcript through Meeting recap in new Outlook and Teams.
