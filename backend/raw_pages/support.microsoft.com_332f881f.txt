## Live c​​​​​​​aptions in Teams

Teams can detect what’s said in a meeting and present real-time captions. If you're using the desktop app for Windows or Mac, there are also several caption customization options.

**Notes:**

* People can choose not to be identified in captions. For details, see [Hide your identity in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).
* Teams doesn't save captions. If you'd like a transcript of the meeting, turn on transcription. You'll be able to download the transcript after the meeting.

There are a couple ways to get live captions in Teams:

* From the built-in captioning provided by Teams
* From a Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART) captioner. To learn how to use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting, refer to [Use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting (human generated captions)](/en-us/office/use-cart-captions-in-a-microsoft-teams-meeting-human-generated-captions-2dd889e8-32a8-4582-98b8-6c96cf14eb47).

## Live caption settings

Teams has built-in closed captioning you can turn on from the meeting controls.

### Turn captions on and off

* To use live captions in a meeting, go to your meeting controls at the top of the screen and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Show live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).
* To stop using live captions, go to your meeting controls and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Hide live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).

### Change the spoken language

Set a meeting’s spoken language to the language people are speaking for more accurate captions.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To access the meeting spoken language settings:

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
2. In the **Meeting spoken language** dropdown menu, select the language everyone is speaking from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Update** to change.

**Important:**For other participants to access the meeting spoken language, transcription must be turned off. If there’s an ongoing transcription, they must first turn it off or turn off the feature that started the transcription. Then, they must manually turn transcription on again.

## Set up live translated captions in an event

In town halls and live events, organizers preselect which languages attendees can see live captions in. Organizers can select six languages, or ten if they have Premium, from over 50 different languages.

### To set up live translated captions in an event:

1. Open the event in your Teams calendar.
2. In **Details**, select **Meeting options** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e).
3. In **Engagement**​​​​​​​  ![Teams Chat Tab icon](/images/en-us/3c2a24f3-7e8f-4419-8c78-16c5a795d45f) > **Translate attendee captions**, select the languages that live translated captions will be available in during your event.  
     
   ![Meeting option showing how to add languages for live translated captions in an event.](/images/en-us/7249ee23-9636-4844-b2a0-f0dae56359f7)
4. Select **Apply**.

Attendees can see live translated captions in only one of the languages you preselected.

## Use live translated captions

By default, live captions are shown in the language used during the meeting or event. Live translated captions allow users to see captions translated into the language they’re most comfortable with.

**Note:**Live translated captions in meetings are only available as part of Teams Premium, an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to Teams Premium, contact your IT admin.

### To use live translated captions:

1. Turn on live captions in your meeting.
2. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
3. Make sure **Meeting spoken language** is correct.
4. Turn on the **Translate to** toggle.
5. In the dropdown menu, select the language you want your captions translated to.

### Customize captions

If you're using the desktop app on Windows or Mac, you can customize the font size and color, increase the number of lines displayed, and change the positioning of the captions in the meeting window.

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Caption styles** ![Color icon in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/8fdf1401-2b5e-4511-81a1-83c9e4e2f20f).

### Get the most out of your captions

To make sure your live captions are as accurate as possible, try these best practices:

* Speak clearly, slowly, and directly into the mic. As your distance from the mic increases, captions may become less accurate.
* Avoid locations with background noise.
* Avoid having multiple people speak at the same time.
* Use the highest-quality [Teams-certified equipment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086056) available to you.

**Note:**Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### FAQ

#### Where does Teams process the data it uses to provide live captions?

We process the data in the geographical region where your organization is based.

#### What data does Teams use to create the captions?

The Microsoft Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology service, which generates Teams meeting captions, may use a meeting's subject, invitation, participant names, attachments, and recent emails of the participants to improve the accuracy of captions.

#### How does Teams translate live captions?

We use the Microsoft Speech Translation technology powered by Azure Cognitive Services for translating live captions.

#### Who has access to this data?

No one. Microsoft ASR involves no human intervention, and no one can access the meeting audio or any other meeting information at any time.

#### Does Teams store any caption data?

No. Caption data is permanently deleted after the meeting is over.

#### If I don't want Teams to process this data to begin with, can I prevent it?

Yes. Simply don't turn on live captions. Your admin can also disable the feature altogether. Go [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy?view=skype-ps)for more info about how to do that.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

Teams can detect what's said in a meeting or group call and present real-time captions.

**Note:**Captions aren't yet available in government clouds on the Teams mobile app.
