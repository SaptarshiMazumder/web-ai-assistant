More than 60 migrants were killed when their overloaded boat capsized as they tried to cross the sea between the Horn of Africa and Yemen, the International Organization for Migration said on Sunday.

The boat trip across the Gulf of Aden is the first part of one of the most dangerous [migration and smuggling routes](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/12/world/middleeast/ethiopia-yemen-american-bombs.html) in the world, which desperate men and women from Ethiopia and other East African countries traverse as they attempt to reach oil-rich Saudi Arabia.

The boat, believed to have been carrying 150 people, capsized on Saturday night near the southern Yemeni province of Abyan, Yemeni health and security officials said. The I.O.M. said in a statement said that 68 Ethiopian migrants had died. There were at least 12 survivors. An unknown number of passengers remain missing. The death toll is expected to rise as more bodies wash ashore, the local officials said.
