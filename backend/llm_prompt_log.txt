# Add tools¶

To handle queries that your chatbot can't answer "from memory", integrate a web search tool. The chatbot can use this tool to find relevant information and provide better responses.

Note

This tutorial builds on Build a basic chatbot.

## Prerequisites¶

Before you start this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

* An API key for the Tavily Search Engine.

## 1. Install the search engine¶

Install the requirements to use the Tavily Search Engine:

```
pip install -U langchain-tavily

```

## 2. Configure your environment¶

Configure your environment with your search engine API key:

```
import os

os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = "tvly-..."

```

## 3. Define the tool¶

Define the web search tool:

*API Reference: TavilySearch*

```
from langchain_tavily import TavilySearch

tool = TavilySearch(max_results=2)
tools = [tool]
tool.invoke("What's a 'node' in LangGraph?")

```

The results are page summaries our chat bot can use to answer questions:

```
{'query': "What's a 'node' in LangGraph?",
'follow_up_questions': None,
'answer': None,
'images': [],
'results': [{'title': "Introduction to LangGraph: A Beginner's Guide - Medium",
'url': '
'content': 'Stateful Graph: LangGraph revolves around the concept of a stateful graph, where each node in the graph represents a step in your computation, and the graph maintains a state that is passed around and updated as the computation progresses. LangGraph supports conditional edges, allowing you to dynamically determine the next node to execute based on the current state of the graph. We define nodes for classifying the input, handling greetings, and handling search queries. def classify_input_node(state): LangGraph is a versatile tool for building complex, stateful applications with LLMs. By understanding its core concepts and working through simple examples, beginners can start to leverage its power for their projects.

Whether you need a chatbot that can handle various types of user requests or a multi-agent system that performs complex tasks, LangGraph provides the tools to build exactly what you need. LangGraph significantly simplifies the development of complex LLM applications by providing a structured framework for managing state and coordinating agent interactions.',
'score': 0.5008063,
'raw_content': None}],
'response_time': 1.38}

```

## 4. Define the graph¶

For the `StateGraph` you created in the first tutorial, add `bind_tools` on the LLM. This lets the LLM know the correct JSON format to use if it wants to use the search engine.

Let's first select our LLM:

[OpenAI](#__tabbed_1_1)[Anthropic](#__tabbed_1_2)[Azure](#__tabbed_1_3)[Google Gemini](#__tabbed_1_4)[AWS Bedrock](#__tabbed_1_5)

```
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

llm = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4.1")

```

👉 Read the OpenAI integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[anthropic]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

llm = init_chat_model("anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

```

👉 Read the Anthropic integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = "..."
os.environ["OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2025-03-01-preview"

llm = init_chat_model(
    "azure_openai:gpt-4.1",
    azure_deployment=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],
)

```

👉 Read the Azure integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[google-genai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "..."

llm = init_chat_model("google_genai:gemini-2.0-flash")

```

👉 Read the Google GenAI integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[aws]"

```

```
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

# Follow the steps here to configure your credentials:
# 

llm = init_chat_model(
    "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0",
    model_provider="bedrock_converse",
)

```

👉 Read the AWS Bedrock integration docs

We can now incorporate it into a `StateGraph`:

*API Reference: StateGraph | START | END | add\_messages*

```
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Modification: tell the LLM which tools it can call
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

```

## 5. Create a function to run the tools¶

Now, create a function to run the tools if they are called. Do this by adding the tools to a new node called `BasicToolNode` that checks the most recent message in the state and calls tools if the message contains `tool_calls`. It relies on the LLM's `tool_calling` support, which is available in Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and a number of other LLM providers.

*API Reference: ToolMessage*

```
import json

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage

class BasicToolNode:
    """A node that runs the tools requested in the last AIMessage."""

    def __init__(self, tools: list) -> None:
        self.tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

    def __call__(self, inputs: dict):
        if messages := inputs.get("messages", []):
            message = messages[-1]
        else:
            raise ValueError("No message found in input")
        outputs = []
        for tool_call in message.tool_calls:
            tool_result = self.tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(
                tool_call["args"]
            )
            outputs.append(
                ToolMessage(
                    content=json.dumps(tool_result),
                    name=tool_call["name"],
                    tool_call_id=tool_call["id"],
                )
            )
        return {"messages": outputs}

tool_node = BasicToolNode(tools=[tool])
graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

```

Note

If you do not want to build this yourself in the future, you can use LangGraph's prebuilt ToolNode.

## 6. Define the `conditional_edges`¶

With the tool node added, now you can define the `conditional_edges`.

**Edges** route the control flow from one node to the next. **Conditional edges** start from a single node and usually contain "if" statements to route to different nodes depending on the current graph state. These functions receive the current graph `state` and return a string or list of strings indicating which node(s) to call next.

Next, define a router function called `route_tools` that checks for `tool_calls` in the chatbot's output. Provide this function to the graph by calling `add_conditional_edges`, which tells the graph that whenever the `chatbot` node completes to check this function to see where to go next.

The condition will route to `tools` if tool calls are present and `END` if not. Because the condition can return `END`, you do not need to explicitly set a `finish_point` this time.

```
def route_tools(
    state: State,
):
    """
    Use in the conditional_edge to route to the ToolNode if the last message
    has tool calls. Otherwise, route to the end.
    """
    if isinstance(state, list):
        ai_message = state[-1]
    elif messages := state.get("messages", []):
        ai_message = messages[-1]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"No messages found in input state to tool_edge: {state}")
    if hasattr(ai_message, "tool_calls") and len(ai_message.tool_calls) > 0:
        return "tools"
    return END

# The `tools_condition` function returns "tools" if the chatbot asks to use a tool, and "END" if
# it is fine directly responding. This conditional routing defines the main agent loop.
graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "chatbot",
    route_tools,
    # The following dictionary lets you tell the graph to interpret the condition's outputs as a specific node
    # It defaults to the identity function, but if you
    # want to use a node named something else apart from "tools",
    # You can update the value of the dictionary to something else
    # e.g., "tools": "my_tools"
    {"tools": "tools", END: END},
)
# Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph = graph_builder.compile()

```

Note

You can replace this with the prebuilt tools\_condition to be more concise.

## 7. Visualize the graph (optional)¶

You can visualize the graph using the `get_graph` method and one of the "draw" methods, like `draw_ascii` or `draw_png`. The `draw` methods each require additional dependencies.

```
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

```

!chatbot-with-tools-diagram

## 8. Ask the bot questions¶

Now you can ask the chatbot questions outside its training data:

```
def stream_graph_updates(user_input: str):
    for event in graph.stream({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]}):
        for value in event.values():
            print("Assistant:", value["messages"][-1].content)

while True:
    try:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit", "q"]:
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
    except:
        # fallback if input() is not available
        user_input = "What do you know about LangGraph?"
        print("User: " + user_input)
        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
        break

```

```

```

**Congratulations!** You've created a conversational agent in LangGraph that can use a search engine to retrieve updated information when needed. Now it can handle a wider range of user queries.

To inspect all the steps your agent just took, check out this LangSmith trace.

## Next steps¶

The chatbot cannot remember past interactions on its own, which limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the next part, you will add **memory** to address this.
