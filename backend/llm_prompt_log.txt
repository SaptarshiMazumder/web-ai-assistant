Prepare data for ingesting
bookmark_border

How you prepare data depends on the kind of data you're importing and the way you choose to import it. Start with what kind of data you plan to import:

Website data
Unstructured data
Structured data
Structured media data
Healthcare FHIR data

For information about blended search, where multiple data stores can be connected to a single custom search app, see About connecting multiple data stores.

Website data

When you create a data store for website data, you provide the URLs of web pages that Google should crawl and index for searching or recommending.

Before indexing your website data:

Decide which URL patterns to include in your indexing and which to exclude.

Exclude the patterns for dynamic URLs. Dynamic URLs are URLs that change at the time of serving depending on the request.

For example, the URL patterns for the web pages that serve the search results, such as www.example.com/search/*. Suppose, a user searches for the phrase Nobel prize, the dynamic search URL might be a unique URL: www.example.com/search?q=nobel%20prize/UNIQUE_STRING. If the URL pattern www.example.com/search/* is not excluded, then all such unique, dynamic search URLs that follow this pattern are indexed. This results in a bloated index and a diluted search quality.

Eliminate duplicate URLs using canonical URL patterns. This provides a single canonical URL for Google Search when crawling the website and removes ambiguity. For examples of canonicalization and more information, see What is URL canonicalization and How to specify a canonical URL with rel="canonical" and other methods.

You can include URL patterns either from the same or different domains that need to be indexed and exclude patterns that must not be indexed. The number of URL patterns that you can include and exclude differs in the following way:

Indexing type	Included sites	Excluded sites
Basic website search	Maximum of 50 URL patterns	Maximum of 50 URL patterns
Advanced website indexing	Maximum of 500 URL patterns	Maximum of 500 URL patterns

Check that the web pages you plan to provide are not using robots.txt to block indexing. For more information, see Introduction to robot.txt.

If you plan to use Advanced website indexing, you must be able to verify the domains for the URL patterns in your data store.

Add structured data in the form of meta tags and PageMaps to your data store schema to enrich your indexing as explained in Use structured data for advanced website indexing.

Unstructured data

Vertex AI Search supports search over documents that are in HTML, PDF with embedded text, and TXT format. PPTX and DOCX formats are available in Preview.

You import your documents from a Cloud Storage bucket. You can import using Google Cloud console, by the ImportDocuments method, or by streaming ingestion through CRUD methods. For API reference information, see DocumentService and documents.

The following table lists the file size limits of each file type with different configurations (for more information, see Parse and chunk documents). You can import up to 100,000 files at a time.

File type	Default import	Import with layout-aware document chunking	Import with layout parser
Text-based files such as HTML, TXT, JSON, XHTML, and XML	< 200 MB	< 10 MB	< 10 MB
PPTX, DOCX, and XLSX	< 200 MB	< 200 MB	< 200 MB
PDF	< 200 MB	< 200 MB	< 40 MB

If you plan to include embeddings in your unstructured data, see Use custom embeddings.

If you have non-searchable PDFs (scanned PDFs or PDFs with text inside images, such as infographics), we recommend turning on the layout parser during data store creation. This allows Vertex AI Search to extract elements such as text blocks and tables. If you have searchable PDFs that are mostly composed of machine-readable text and contain many tables, you can consider turning on OCR processing with the option for machine-readable text enabled in order to improve detection and parsing. For more information, see Parse and chunk documents.

If you want to use Vertex AI Search for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), turn on document chunking when you create your data store. For more information, see Parse and chunk documents.

You can import unstructured data from the following sources:

Cloud Storage
BigQuery
Google Drive
Cloud Storage

You can import data from Cloud Storage with or without metadata.

Data import is recursive. That is, if there are folders within the bucket or folder that you specify, files within those folders are imported.

If you plan to import documents from Cloud Storage without metadata, put your documents directly into a Cloud Storage bucket. The document ID is an example of metadata.

For testing, you can use the following publicly available Cloud Storage folders, which contain PDFs:

gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/alphabet-investor-pdfs
gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/CUAD_v1
gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/kaiser-health-surveys
gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/stanford-cs-224

If you plan to import data from Cloud Storage with metadata, put a JSON file that contains the metadata into a Cloud Storage bucket whose location you provide during import.

Your unstructured documents can be in the same Cloud Storage bucket as your metadata or a different one.

The metadata file must be a JSON Lines or an NDJSON file. The document ID is an example of metadata. Each row of the metadata file must follow one of the following JSON formats:

Using jsonData:
{ "id": "<your-id>", "jsonData": "<JSON string>", "content": { "mimeType": "<application/pdf or text/html>", "uri": "gs://<your-gcs-bucket>/directory/filename.pdf" } }
Using structData:
{ "id": "<your-id>", "structData": { <JSON object> }, "content": { "mimeType": "<application/pdf or text/html>", "uri": "gs://<your-gcs-bucket>/directory/filename.pdf" } }

Use the uri field in each row to point to the Cloud Storage location of the document.

Here is an example of an NDJSON metadata file for an unstructured document. In this example, each line of the metadata file points to a PDF document and contains the metadata for that document. The first two lines use jsonData and the second two lines use structData. With structData you don't need to escape quotation marks that appear within quotation marks.

{"id":"doc-0","jsonData":"{\"title\":\"test_doc_0\",\"description\":\"This document uses a blue color theme\",\"color_theme\":\"blue\"}","content":{"mimeType":"application/pdf","uri":"gs://test-bucket-12345678/test_doc_0.pdf"}}
{"id":"doc-1","jsonData":"{\"title\":\"test_doc_1\",\"description\":\"This document uses a green color theme\",\"color_theme\":\"green\"}","content":{"mimeType":"application/pdf","uri":"gs://test-bucket-12345678/test_doc_1.pdf"}}
{"id":"doc-2","structData":{"title":"test_doc_2","description":"This document uses a red color theme","color_theme":"red"},"content":{"mimeType":"application/pdf","uri":"gs://test-bucket-12345678/test_doc_3.pdf"}}
{"id":"doc-3","structData":{"title":"test_doc_3","description":"This is document uses a yellow color theme","color_theme":"yellow"},"content":{"mimeType":"application/pdf","uri":"gs://test-bucket-12345678/test_doc_4.pdf"}}

To create your data store, see Create a search data store.

BigQuery

If you plan to import metadata from BigQuery, create a BigQuery table that contains metadata. The document ID is an example of metadata.

Put your unstructured documents into a Cloud Storage bucket.

Use the following BigQuery schema. Use the uri field in each record to point to the Cloud Storage location of the document.

[
  {
    "name": "id",
    "mode": "REQUIRED",
    "type": "STRING",
    "fields": []
  },
  {
    "name": "jsonData",
    "type": "STRING",
    "fields": []
  },
  {
    "name": "content",
    "type": "RECORD",
    "mode": "NULLABLE",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "mimeType",
        "type": "STRING",
        "mode": "NULLABLE"
      },
      {
        "name": "uri",
        "type": "STRING",
        "mode": "NULLABLE"
      }
    ]
  }
]

For more information, see Create and use tables in the BigQuery documentation.

To create your data store, see Create a search data store.

Google Drive

Syncing data from Google Drive is supported for custom search.

If you plan to import data from Google Drive, you must set up Google Identity as your identity provider in AI Applications. For information about setting up access control, see Use data source access control.

To create your data store, see Create a search data store.

Structured data

Prepare your data according to the import method that you plan to use. If you plan to ingest media data, also see Structured media data.

You can import structured data from the following sources:

Cloud Storage
Local JSON data

When you import structured data from BigQuery or from Cloud Storage, you are given the option to import the data with metadata. (Structured with metadata is also referred to as enhanced structured data.)

BigQuery

You can import structured data from BigQuery datasets.

Your schema is auto-detected. After importing, Google recommends that you edit the auto-detected schema to map key properties, such as titles. If you import using the API instead of the Google Cloud console, you have the option to provide your own schema as a JSON object. For more information, see Provide or auto-detect a schema.

For examples of publicly available structured data, see the BigQuery public datasets.

If you plan to include embeddings in your structured data, see Use custom embeddings.

If you select to import structured data with metadata, you include two fields in your BigQuery tables:

An id field to identify the document. If you import structured data without metadata, then the id is generated for you. Including metadata lets you specify the value of id.

A jsonData field that contains the data. For examples of jsonData strings, see the preceding section Cloud Storage.

Use the following BigQuery schema for structured data with metadata imports:

[
  {
    "name": "id",
    "mode": "REQUIRED",
    "type": "STRING",
    "fields": []
  },
  {
    "name": "jsonData",
    "mode": "NULLABLE",
    "type": "STRING",
    "fields": []
  }
]

For instructions on creating your data store, see Create a search data store or Create a recommendations data store.

Note: You can't import from BigQuery tables that have external data sources. For general information about external data sources in BigQuery, see Introduction to external tables in the BigQuery documentation.
Cloud Storage

Structured data in Cloud Storage must be in either JSON Lines or NDJSON format. Each file must be 2 GB or smaller. You can import up to 1,000 files in a single import request.

For examples of publicly available structured data, refer to the following folders in Cloud Storage, which contain NDJSON files:

gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/kaggle_movies
gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/austin_311

If you plan to include embeddings in your structured data, see Use custom embeddings.

Here is an example of an NDJSON metadata file of structured data. Each line of the file represents a document and is made up of a set of fields.

{"id": 10001, "title": "Hotel 1", "location": {"address": "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043"}, "available_date": "2024-02-10", "non_smoking": true, "rating": 3.7, "room_types": ["Deluxe", "Single", "Suite"]}
{"id": 10002, "title": "Hotel 2", "location": {"address": "Manhattan, New York, NY 10001"}, "available_date": "2023-07-10", "non_smoking": false, "rating": 5.0, "room_types": ["Deluxe", "Double", "Suite"]}
{"id": 10003, "title": "Hotel 3", "location": {"address": "Moffett Park, Sunnyvale, CA 94089"}, "available_date": "2023-06-24", "non_smoking": true, "rating": 2.5, "room_types": ["Double", "Penthouse", "Suite"]}

To create your data store, see Create a search data store or Create a recommendations data store.

Local JSON data

You can directly upload a JSON document or object using the API.

Google recommends providing your own schema as a JSON object for better results. If you don't provide your own schema, the schema is auto-detected. After importing, we recommend that you edit the auto-detected schema to map key properties, such as titles. For more information, see Provide or auto-detect a schema.

If you plan to include embeddings in your structured data, see Use custom embeddings.

To create your data store, see Create a search data store or Create a recommendations data store.

Structured media data

If you plan to ingest structured media data, such as videos, news, or music, review the following:

Information about your import method (BigQuery or Cloud Storage): Structured data
Required schemas and fields for media documents and data stores: About media documents and data stores
User event requirements and schemas: About media user events
Information about media recommendations types: About media recommendations types
Healthcare FHIR data

If you plan to ingest FHIR data from Cloud Healthcare API, ensure the following:

Location: The source FHIR store must be in a Cloud Healthcare API dataset that's in the us-central1, us, or eu location. For more information, see Create and manage datasets in Cloud Healthcare API.
FHIR store type: The source FHIR store must be an R4 data store. You can check the versions of your FHIR stores by listing the FHIR stores in your dataset. To create a FHIR R4 store, see Create FHIR stores.
Import quota: The source FHIR store must have fewer than 1 million FHIR resources. If there are more than 1 million FHIR resources, the import process stops after this limit is reached. For more information, see Quotas and limits.
The files referenced in a DocumentReference resource must be PDF, RTF, or image files that are stored in Cloud Storage. The link to the referenced files must be in the content[].attachment.url field of the resource in the standard Cloud Storage path format: gs://BUCKET_NAME/PATH_TO_REFERENCED_FILE.
Review the list of FHIR R4 resources that Vertex AI Search supports. For more information, see Healthcare FHIR R4 data schema reference.
Resource references: Ensure that relative resource references are in the format Resource/resourceId. For example, subject.reference must have its value as Patient/034AB16. For more information on how Cloud Healthcare API supports FHIR resource references, see FHIR resource references.

Introduction to the Outlook Calendar
Applies To
We think you'll enjoy trying Microsoft 365

We're giving you a free trial of Outlook.

Click to unlock Outlook

Calendar is the calendar and scheduling component of Outlook that is fully integrated with email, contacts, and other features.

Just as you write in a notebook, you can select any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start typing. By using the Calendar you can create appointments and events, organize meetings, view group schedules, and much more.

Create appointments and events     

Select any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start to type to create your appointment or event. You can opt to have a sound or message remind you of appointments, meetings, and events, and you can color items for quick identification.

For more information, see Create or schedule an appointment and Create an event.

Organize meetings    

Select a time on the Calendar, create a meeting request, and select the people to invite. Outlook helps you find the earliest time when all the invitees are free. When you send the meeting request by email, the invitees receive the request in their Inbox. When the invitees open the request, they can accept, tentatively accept, or decline your meeting by selecting a single button. If your request conflicts with an item on the invitees' Calendar, Outlook displays a notification. If you, as the meeting organizer, allow this, invitees can propose an alternative meeting time. As the organizer, you can track who accepts or declines the request or who proposes another time for the meeting by opening the request.

For more information, see Schedule a meeting with other people.

View group schedules    

You can create calendars that show the schedules of a group of people or resources. For example, you can view the schedules of all the people in your department or all the resources, such as conference rooms, in your building. This helps you schedule meetings quickly.

View calendars side-by-side    

You can view side-by-side multiple calendars that you created and also calendars shared by other Outlook users. For example, you can create a separate calendar for your personal appointments and view both your work and personal calendars side-by-side.

For more information, see View multiple calendars at the same time.

You can also copy or move appointments between the displayed calendars. Use the Navigation Pane to quickly share your own calendar and open other shared calendars. Depending on the permissions granted by the owner of a calendar, you can simply view another person's calendar, or create appointments on shared calendars.

For more information, see Share and access a view-only calendar in Outlook and Share and access a calendar using edit or delegate permissions in Outlook.

View calendars on top of one another in overlay view     

You can use overlay view to display multiple calendars that you created and also calendars shared by other Outlook users. For example, you can create a separate calendar for your personal appointments and overlay your work and personal calendars to quickly see where you have conflicts or free time.

For more information, see View multiple calendars at the same time.

Link to calendars on Microsoft SharePoint sites    

If you have access to a SharePoint site, you can view the lists of events from that site in your Outlook Calendar. You can change the list in Outlook, even when you are working offline. The changes are automatically synchronized when you connect to the Internet again. Also, you can view the SharePoint calendars side-by-side with other personal or shared calendars.

Send calendars to anyone through email    

You can send your calendar to a mail recipient as an Internet Calendar, but keep control over how much information is shared. Your calendar information appears in the body of the email message as an Internet Calendar attachment that the recipient can open in Outlook.

For more information, see Introduction to calendar sharing.

Subscribe to Internet Calendars    

Internet Calendar Subscriptions resemble Internet Calendars, except that the downloaded calendar is synchronized regularly with the Internet Calendar and updated.

Manage another user's calendar    

With the Delegate Access feature, one person can use his or her own copy of Outlook to easily manage another person's calendar. For example, an administrative assistant can manage the calendar of a manager. When the manager designates the assistant as a delegate, the assistant can create, move, or delete appointments and can organize meetings on the manager's behalf.

For more information, see Manage another person's mail and calendar items.

For more information, see Share and access a view-only calendar in Outlook and Share and access a calendar using edit or delegate permissions in Outlook.

View calendars on top of one another in overlay view     

You can use overlay view to display multiple calendars that you created and also calendars shared by other Outlook users. For example, you can create a separate calendar for your personal appointments and overlay your work and personal calendars to quickly see where you have conflicts or free time.

For more information, see View multiple calendars at the same time.

Link to calendars on Microsoft SharePoint sites    

If you have access to a SharePoint site, you can view the lists of events from that site in your Outlook Calendar. You can change the list in Outlook, even when you are working offline. The changes are automatically synchronized when you connect to the Internet again. Also, you can view the SharePoint calendars side-by-side with other personal or shared calendars.

Send calendars to anyone through email    

You can send your calendar to a mail recipient as an Internet Calendar, but keep control over how much information is shared. Your calendar information appears in the body of the email message as an Internet Calendar attachment that the recipient can open in Outlook.

For more information, see Introduction to calendar sharing.

Subscribe to Internet Calendars    

Internet Calendar Subscriptions resemble Internet Calendars, except that the downloaded calendar is synchronized regularly with the Internet Calendar and updated.

Manage another user's calendar    

With the Delegate Access feature, one person can use his or her own copy of Outlook to easily manage another person's calendar. For example, an administrative assistant can manage the calendar of a manager. When the manager designates the assistant as a delegate, the assistant can create, move, or delete appointments and can organize meetings on the manager's behalf.

For more information, see Manage another person's mail and calendar items.

Color categories in Outlook help you more easily recognize and organize related items. You can apply them to meetings, appointments, emails, notes, contacts, and more.

Once assigned, the color category indication appears within the individual item and also in collective table views (e.g., Inbox). If needed, you can assign multiple color categories to a single item. You can also customize the names and colors of your available color category set.

**Note:**If you apply a color category to a meeting or request that you've received from another person, the color category selection will not affect their Outlook view. Your category selections apply only to items within your calendar.

Select a tab option below for the version of Outlook you're using. What version of Outlook do I have?
