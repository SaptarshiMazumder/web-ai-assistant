  Yes, new and upgrading customers on the T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™ plans are covered by our 5- year price guarantee. 5-year price guarantee means that we won't change the price of fixed-wireless 5G internet data for at least 5 years while you are on an eligible plan. Taxes & fees, voluntary equipment or speed upgrades, future wireless generations, select limited-time promotions, per-use charges, third-party services, and network management practices aren't included.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500.

* ### How fast is 5G home internet (in Mbps) compared to cable?

  T-Mobile All-In or Amplified Home Internet customers delivering typical speeds between 134 mbps – 415 mbps. Typical upload speeds are between 12 – 55 Mbps. 25% of our customers see speeds below and 25% see speeds above these ranges.

  Keep in mind that speeds can vary depending on location, time of day, signal strength and availability, and other factors. Click here for more info.

  While we can’t directly compare speeds for T-Mobile 5G Home Internet vs. Xfinity, Spectrum, Comcast, Cox, etc., you can check your current speeds here and see for yourself. Best of all, you have nothing to lose, since you can try out T-Mobile Home Internet first to make sure you find a plan that works for you.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### How is T-Mobile Fiber internet installed?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.
* ### Why is fiber technology better than cable?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will i be charged for installation?

  Nope! Installation is included in the cost of your plan.
* ### Why am I not eligible for 5G internet?

  The service is available in select areas based on T-Mobile's current wireless network. It may not be available in your area yet, but as we expand T-Mobile Home Internet, we'll prioritize areas with the highest demand.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* ### I don't live in any of the cities with a Riot office. Is there an opportunity to work remotely?

  We take a hybrid approach by entrusting teams to decide the right rhythm for in-person vs remote work. With that being said, we’ll still expect most Rioters to live in the same state as their home office (or the same country in the case of our global offices).
* ### I want to work at one of Riot's global offices but I’m not a citizen of that country. Is that possible?

  Working globally depends on the immigration restrictions of the relevant country/region. If you apply to a role in a global office, those recruiting teams will respond if they see a match.
* ### Can I apply for multiple jobs?

  We want applicants to think deeply about their skills and interest—and how they line up with the jobs available at Riot. It's not a good sign if you find yourself applying to as many open positions as possible.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* ### I don't live in any of the cities with a Riot office. Is there an opportunity to work remotely?

  We take a hybrid approach by entrusting teams to decide the right rhythm for in-person vs remote work. With that being said, we’ll still expect most Rioters to live in the same state as their home office (or the same country in the case of our global offices).
* ### I want to work at one of Riot's global offices but I’m not a citizen of that country. Is that possible?

  Working globally depends on the immigration restrictions of the relevant country/region. If you apply to a role in a global office, those recruiting teams will respond if they see a match.
* ### Can I apply for multiple jobs?

  We want applicants to think deeply about their skills and interest—and how they line up with the jobs available at Riot. It's not a good sign if you find yourself applying to as many open positions as possible.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.
* ### How fast is 5G home internet (in Mbps) compared to cable?

  T-Mobile All-In or Amplified Home Internet customers delivering typical speeds between 134 mbps – 415 mbps. Typical upload speeds are between 12 – 55 Mbps. 25% of our customers see speeds below and 25% see speeds above these ranges.

  Keep in mind that speeds can vary depending on location, time of day, signal strength and availability, and other factors. Click here for more info.

Taxes & fees, voluntary equipment or speed upgrades, future wireless generations, select limited-time promotions, per-use charges, third-party services, and network management practices aren't included.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.
* ### How fast is 5G home internet (in Mbps) compared to cable?

  The service is available in select areas based on T-Mobile's current wireless network. It may not be available in your area yet, but as we expand T-Mobile Home Internet, we'll prioritize areas with the highest demand.

IAM Policies Hands On
Introduction to IAM Policies

Let's examine IAM policies in depth. First, navigate to the users section. For example, the user Stephane is part of the admin group, which grants administrator access permissions to AWS.

Using the user Stephane to access the IAM console, you can see the user listed under users. Since Stephane belongs to the admin group, they have permission to perform any action as an administrator.

Removing User from Admin Group

To demonstrate permission changes, remove the user Stephane from the admin group. Once removed, Stephane loses the administrator permissions previously granted by the group.

After removal, refreshing the users page results in an access denied error, indicating that the user no longer has permission to perform the iamListUsers action. This confirms that removing a user from a group revokes their permissions accordingly.

Restoring Permissions by Attaching Policies

To restore permissions for Stephane, navigate to the user and add permissions. Instead of adding the user back to a group, attach policies directly to the user. For example, attach the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy to allow read-only access to IAM resources.

After attaching the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy, refreshing the users page allows viewing users and user groups but restricts creating new groups. Attempting to create a group results in an access denied error, demonstrating that read-only access limits modification capabilities.

This example illustrates that permissions should be granted strictly according to the user's required actions. To allow creating groups, a broader permission set such as IAM full access must be attached.

Creating User Groups and Assigning Policies

Next, create a new group named developers. Add the user Stephane to this group and attach any policy, such as AlexaForBusiness, to demonstrate policy inheritance through groups.

Also, re-add Stephane to the admin group. Now, the user Stephane has multiple permission policies attached: administrator access inherited from the admin group, AlexaForBusiness managed policy from the developers group, and the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy attached directly.

This demonstrates how permissions can be inherited from multiple sources, including groups and direct attachments.

Understanding IAM Policies in Detail

Navigate to the policies section to examine specific policies. For example, the AdministratorAccess policy grants full access to all AWS services and resources.

Viewing the JSON of this policy reveals that it allows all actions (Action: "*") on all resources (Resource: "*"). This effectively grants administrator access.

In contrast, the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy authorizes specific API calls such as List and Get actions on IAM resources. The JSON document lists allowed actions like iam:ListUsers and iam:GetUser with effect set to allow.

Using wildcards such as Get* or List* groups multiple API calls together, simplifying policy definitions.

Creating Custom IAM Policies

You can create custom policies using either the visual editor or the JSON editor. For example, to create a policy that allows only ListUsers and GetUser actions on IAM, select these actions in the visual editor and specify the resources to which the policy applies.

After creating the policy, review the JSON to confirm that it includes the intended permissions. This custom policy can then be attached to users or groups as needed.

Cleaning Up and Finalizing

To conclude, delete the developers group if it is no longer needed. Remove any directly attached policies such as IAMReadOnlyAccess from the user Stephane, leaving only the admin group membership with administrator access.

Verifying the IAM console shows that the user Stephane has full access again, confirming that permissions are correctly managed through group memberships and attached policies.

Key Takeaways
IAM user permissions are managed through group memberships and attached policies.
Removing a user from an admin group revokes their administrator access immediately.
Read-only access policies allow viewing but restrict modification actions.
Custom IAM policies can be created using the visual or JSON editor to specify precise permissions.

AI may make mistakes. Verify for accuracy.

IAM Policies Hands On
Introduction to IAM Policies

Let's examine IAM policies in depth. First, navigate to the users section. For example, the user Stephane is part of the admin group, which grants administrator access permissions to AWS.

Using the user Stephane to access the IAM console, you can see the user listed under users. Since Stephane belongs to the admin group, they have permission to perform any action as an administrator.

Removing User from Admin Group

To demonstrate permission changes, remove the user Stephane from the admin group. Once removed, Stephane loses the administrator permissions previously granted by the group.

After removal, refreshing the users page results in an access denied error, indicating that the user no longer has permission to perform the iamListUsers action. This confirms that removing a user from a group revokes their permissions accordingly.

Restoring Permissions by Attaching Policies

To restore permissions for Stephane, navigate to the user and add permissions. Instead of adding the user back to a group, attach policies directly to the user. For example, attach the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy to allow read-only access to IAM resources.

After attaching the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy, refreshing the users page allows viewing users and user groups but restricts creating new groups. Attempting to create a group results in an access denied error, demonstrating that read-only access limits modification capabilities.

This example illustrates that permissions should be granted strictly according to the user's required actions. To allow creating groups, a broader permission set such as IAM full access must be attached.

Creating User Groups and Assigning Policies

Next, create a new group named developers. Add the user Stephane to this group and attach any policy, such as AlexaForBusiness, to demonstrate policy inheritance through groups.

Also, re-add Stephane to the admin group. Now, the user Stephane has multiple permission policies attached: administrator access inherited from the admin group, AlexaForBusiness managed policy from the developers group, and the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy attached directly.

This demonstrates how permissions can be inherited from multiple sources, including groups and direct attachments.

Understanding IAM Policies in Detail

Navigate to the policies section to examine specific policies. For example, the AdministratorAccess policy grants full access to all AWS services and resources.

Viewing the JSON of this policy reveals that it allows all actions (Action: "*") on all resources (Resource: "*"). This effectively grants administrator access.

In contrast, the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy authorizes specific API calls such as List and Get actions on IAM resources. The JSON document lists allowed actions like iam:ListUsers and iam:GetUser with effect set to allow.

Using wildcards such as Get* or List* groups multiple API calls together, simplifying policy definitions.

Creating Custom IAM Policies

You can create custom policies using either the visual editor or the JSON editor. For example, to create a policy that allows only ListUsers and GetUser actions on IAM, select these actions in the visual editor and specify the resources to which the policy applies.

After creating the policy, review the JSON to confirm that it includes the intended permissions. This custom policy can then be attached to users or groups as needed.

Cleaning Up and Finalizing

To conclude, delete the developers group if it is no longer needed. Remove any directly attached policies such as IAMReadOnlyAccess from the user Stephane, leaving only the admin group membership with administrator access.

Verifying the IAM console shows that the user Stephane has full access again, confirming that permissions are correctly managed through group memberships and attached policies.

Key Takeaways
IAM user permissions are managed through group memberships and attached policies.
Removing a user from an admin group revokes their administrator access immediately.
Read-only access policies allow viewing but restrict modification actions.
Custom IAM policies can be created using the visual or JSON editor to specify precise permissions.

AI may make mistakes. Verify for accuracy.

The only place where 7 cross roads come together and the lights all turn red at the same time. Thousands of pedestrians then all cross at the same time. Just amazing.

The area
2 Chome-2-1 Dogenzaka, Shibuya 150-0043 Tokyo Prefecture
Neighborhood: Shibuya / Harajuku / Ebisu
There are countless opportunities to shop in the Shibuya and Harajuku districts, especially in shops that focus on Japan's "Kawaii" culture. The trendiest areas are around Shibuya’s Center district, Harajuku's Takeshita-dori and in Omotesando. If you need to recharge from all the shopping, you can easily refresh yourself in Meiji Jingu or Sasaki Park. In contrast, Ebisu has a more grown up ambiance of calm and cool. At the Museum of Yebisu Beer you can learn about the beer that was responsible for the town’s name, and enjoy dining at the popular noodle shops in the surrounding area.

Definitely a must-visit if you’re in Tokyo — it’s one of the most iconic and busiest pedestrian crossings in the world. When the light turns green, you’ll see hundreds of people flowing from every direction at once. It’s a surreal experience, especially at night when the neon lights and giant screens light up the intersection. There’s always something going on around the area too — street performers, pop-up ads, and people filming content. For one of the best views from above, head to the Magnet mall building. On the rooftop, there’s a small bar with a terrace that overlooks the crossing — a perfect spot for taking photos or videos. The bar itself isn’t anything special and entry requires you to buy at least one drink, but the view makes it absolutely worth it. Tip: Try visiting at around 5-7pm or after sunset for the most dramatic visuals. And if the Magnet rooftop feels too crowded, other viewpoints include the Starbucks in Tsutaya or the Shibuya Sky observation deck — though those might be busier or more expensive.

A definite must stop in Tokyo and there are a number of viewing spots from above. You can view for free from the walkway in the shopping centre, go to Starbucks and compete with the crowds for the window, pay a fortune to go up the Shibuya scramble tower (which may be too high???) or go to the Magnet bar - in the block on the right next to Starbucks (as you look at Starbucks). Take the lift to the top floor and for a small fee there is a small bar where you get a drink (coffee/beer/soft drink) included in the price. Plenty of space and a lovely place for an early evening beer to watch the crossing.

I admit it: I arrived very charged. A thousand videos watched, epic scenes in movies, skyrocketing expectations. I imagined a giant intersection, like Times Square with Godzilla crossing the stripes. Instead... eh. It's big, yes, but not HUGE. Live it almost looks like a normal crossing... only with more people, lights and selfie sticks per square meter. But be careful: it's not a scam. It's a perfectly choreographed little mess. When the green shoots in and hundreds of people cross at once from every direction, you feel part of an urban musical in which everyone acts without knowing they are doing it. The real show? Look at it from above: Starbucks or one of the various viewpoints around. That's where you get the magic. On the ground you're just a guy trying not to get hit by a tourist on a scooter. In summary: – Mythical? Yes. – Giant as in the videos? Not really. – To see at least once? Absolutely not. Shibuya Crossing: small, crowded, a bit overrated, but in the end... it gets to your heart. And in Instagram stories. 📸✨

The Shibuya Crossing is a must-see pedestrian crossing in Tokyo, photographed from all angles. A human tide passes through it alternately with cars, whether diagonally or horizontally. Do not hesitate to go day or night, the effect will not be the same! You can observe it for free from many places, such as Shibuya Station tonight, shops nearby or for a fee from buildings like ShibuyaSky for example.

Stepping into Shibuya Crossing is like stepping into the pulse of Tokyo. When the lights turn red for cars, hundreds (sometimes thousands) of pedestrians flood the intersection from all directions. It’s a mesmerizing sight to see people moving in perfect synchronization, crossing in every direction, yet it’s incredibly organized despite the chaos. It is a must see sight for sure. Also the shops nearby are very nice options to buy sourveniers and gifts from Japan.

This is very busy but it's unnecessarily filled with tourists stopping to take pics and video. Surprisingly the traffic moves smooth regardless of the crowd. No cars are honking (not allowed). No cars get "stuck" in the middle of the intersection. It's overcrowded b/c the Shibuya train station is also at that intersection and it was under constructions in Oct 2024.

Shibuya Crossing is an amazing place where thousands of people cross the street in every direction every few minutes. We got to cross the street and then we went up into a building a few floors to take some pictures of the crowds below. It is the bussiest street crossing in the world.

Lots of shops and restaurants in Shibuya, but the crossing was a bit disappointing to me as I realised - it's just a road crossing! OK there's lots of stripes diagonally but that't because Japanese people have to follow the rules and they would not cross diagonally until you draw a crossing on the road. Good for a photo but not much else, I went up to the Starbucks for a free photo otherwise there are some restaurants/bars that have a view higher up.

This is a must see if you are in Tokyo. Go on the subway/JR lines it is right outside the subway exit. It is like a ballet with cars halting people swarming across is all directions then suddenly stopping and cars going again. I could watch it for hours.

One of the main Landmarks of Tokyo
May 2025 • Friends
This is one of the main landmarks of Tokyo. It is just a square, but I think it's so iconic that it's worth a visit. You should definitely cross the diagonal crosswalk and take a picture or two. There are quite a few options to view the crossing from above. We booked the shibuya sky, which is pretty high up and you have to book well in advance, right when the tickets are released. But there are plenty of other options to view the crossing from a bit closer. What's also fun is to take a timelapse video of people crossing the crosswalks. All in all, I think it's a touristy thing to do but still worth it.

It's right in front of the subway station. It's a very well-known place where hundreds of people pass by at the same time without anyone hitting. It's a place where many Japanese fixed cars go by. Known for the movie Fast and Furious Tokyo

Fun while crossing
Jul 2025 • Couples
We first saw Shibuya Crossing a few minutes after arriving by bus from the airport to Tokyo, still with our suitcases. And then we returned here several more times during our stay in Tokyo.

It was fun to watch people (mostly tourists, Japanese people just crossing) taking pictures, filming and posing while crossing. We did the same. :-) Yes, it is an iconic place and if you are in Tokyo, you definitely shouldn't miss it.

Very busy intersection, in itself not so special but nice to have walked over once.
Many nice shops in DE neighborhood. At DE Shibuya crossing is a restaurant/bar where you have a view over the intersection.

Our iconic neighborhood where thousands of people run to the right to the left, with shops that appeal mostly to under 20, where the nightlife is bustling...
Going with a kid can be torture,even with hundreds in the subway.
Going just to see one day, it’s probably the cheapest Shopping and dining in Tokyo.
If you’re staying in the center, you can get around 15dk from Tokyo Station with one line.

Great buzz in the streets around...
Jun 2025 • Family
The reality is that its a series of zebra crossings with very bright bill boards surrounding it and loads of people around. That said it was fun to see and worth a visit if you are heading to Tokyo just for the buzz in the streets around it, which is the bit we enjoyed most

Zebra crossing in all directions
Sep 2024 • Friends
Shibuya Crossing is one of the most known sightseeing points in Tokyo, the main city in Japan. In fact, it is a place, where some roads link and there are some zebra crossings and you can see, how a lot of people cross the roads in all directions. Really stress! All full of people! A curious place in a very modern city. Not more.

CONTENT:
# Simple Crawling

This guide covers the basics of web crawling with Crawl4AI. You'll learn how to set up a crawler, make your first request, and understand the response.

## Basic Usage

Set up a simple crawl using `BrowserConfig` and `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig()  # Default browser configuration
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()   # Default crawl run configuration

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )
        print(result.markdown)  # Print clean markdown content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

## Understanding the Response

The `arun()` method returns a `CrawlResult` object with several useful properties. Here's a quick overview (see [CrawlResult](../../api/crawl-result/) for complete details):

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
        content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.6),
        options={"ignore_links": True}
    )
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=config
)

# Different content formats
print(result.html)         # Raw HTML
print(result.cleaned_html) # Cleaned HTML
print(result.markdown.raw_markdown) # Raw markdown from cleaned html
print(result.markdown.fit_markdown) # Most relevant content in markdown

# Check success status
print(result.success)      # True if crawl succeeded
print(result.status_code)  # HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404)

# Access extracted media and links
print(result.media)        # Dictionary of found media (images, videos, audio)
print(result.links)        # Dictionary of internal and external links
Copy
```

## Adding Basic Options

Customize your crawl using `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    word_count_threshold=10,        # Minimum words per content block
    exclude_external_links=True,    # Remove external links
    remove_overlay_elements=True,   # Remove popups/modals
    process_iframes=True           # Process iframe content
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=run_config
)
Copy
```

## Handling Errors

Always check if the crawl was successful:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)

if not result.success:
    print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
    print(f"Status code: {result.status_code}")
Copy
```

## Logging and Debugging

Enable verbose logging in `BrowserConfig`:

```
browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)

async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
    result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)
Copy
```

## Complete Example

Here's a more comprehensive example demonstrating common usage patterns:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Content filtering
        word_count_threshold=10,
        excluded_tags=['form', 'header'],
        exclude_external_links=True,

        # Content processing
        process_iframes=True,
        remove_overlay_elements=True,

        # Cache control
        cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED  # Use cache if available
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )

        if result.success:
            # Print clean content
            print("Content:", result.markdown[:500])  # First 500 chars

            # Process images
            for image in result.media["images"]:
                print(f"Found image: {image['src']}")

            # Process links
            for link in result.links["internal"]:
                print(f"Internal link: {link['href']}")

        else:
            print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

# Crawl Dispatcher

We’re excited to announce a **Crawl Dispatcher** module that can handle **thousands** of crawling tasks simultaneously. By efficiently managing system resources (memory, CPU, network), this dispatcher ensures high-performance data extraction at scale. It also provides **real-time monitoring** of each crawler’s status, memory usage, and overall progress.

Stay tuned—this feature is **coming soon** in an upcoming release of Crawl4AI! For the latest news, keep an eye on our changelogs and follow @unclecode on X.

Below is a **sample** of how the dispatcher’s performance monitor might look in action:

# Deep Crawling

One of Crawl4AI's most powerful features is its ability to perform **configurable deep crawling** that can explore websites beyond a single page. With fine-tuned control over crawl depth, domain boundaries, and content filtering, Crawl4AI gives you the tools to extract precisely the content you need.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

1. How to set up a **Basic Deep Crawler** with BFS strategy
2. Understanding the difference between **streamed and non-streamed** output
3. Implementing **filters and scorers** to target specific content
4. Creating **advanced filtering chains** for sophisticated crawls
5. Using **BestFirstCrawling** for intelligent exploration prioritization

> **Prerequisites**  
> - You’ve completed or read [AsyncWebCrawler Basics](../simple-crawling/) to understand how to run a simple crawl.  
> - You know how to configure `CrawlerRunConfig`.

---

## 1. Quick Example

Here's a minimal code snippet that implements a basic deep crawl using the **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy

async def main():
    # Configure a 2-level deep crawl
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
            max_depth=2, 
            include_external=False
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        verbose=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

        print(f"Crawled {len(results)} pages in total")

        # Access individual results
        for result in results[:3]:  # Show first 3 results
            print(f"URL: {result.url}")
            print(f"Depth: {result.metadata.get('depth', 0)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**What's happening?**  
- `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=2, include_external=False)` instructs Crawl4AI to:
- Crawl the starting page (depth 0) plus 2 more levels
- Stay within the same domain (don't follow external links)
- Each result contains metadata like the crawl depth
- Results are returned as a list after all crawling is complete

---

## 2. Understanding Deep Crawling Strategy Options

### 2.1 BFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Breadth-First Search)

The **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a breadth-first approach, exploring all links at one depth before moving deeper:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=50,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.3,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.2 DFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Depth-First Search)

The **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a depth-first approach, explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import DFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=30,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.5,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.3 BestFirstCrawlingStrategy (⭐️ - Recommended Deep crawl strategy)

For more intelligent crawling, use **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy** with scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

# Create a scorer
scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7
)

# Configure the strategy
strategy = BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    include_external=False,
    url_scorer=scorer,
    max_pages=25,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
)
Copy
```

This crawling approach:
- Evaluates each discovered URL based on scorer criteria
- Visits higher-scoring pages first
- Helps focus crawl resources on the most relevant content
- Can limit total pages crawled with `max_pages`
- Does not need `score_threshold` as it naturally prioritizes by score

---

## 3. Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Results

Crawl4AI can return results in two modes:

### 3.1 Non-Streaming Mode (Default)

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=False  # Default behavior
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Wait for ALL results to be collected before returning
    results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

    for result in results:
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**When to use non-streaming mode:**
- You need the complete dataset before processing
- You're performing batch operations on all results together
- Crawl time isn't a critical factor

### 3.2 Streaming Mode

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=True  # Enable streaming
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Returns an async iterator
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        # Process each result as it becomes available
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**Benefits of streaming mode:**
- Process results immediately as they're discovered
- Start working with early results while crawling continues
- Better for real-time applications or progressive display
- Reduces memory pressure when handling many pages

---

## 4. Filtering Content with Filter Chains

Filters help you narrow down which pages to crawl. Combine multiple filters using **FilterChain** for powerful targeting.

### 4.1 Basic URL Pattern Filter

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, URLPatternFilter

# Only follow URLs containing "blog" or "docs"
url_filter = URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*blog*", "*docs*"])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([url_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.2 Combining Multiple Filters

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    URLPatternFilter,
    DomainFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)

# Create a chain of filters
filter_chain = FilterChain([
    # Only follow URLs with specific patterns
    URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*"]),

    # Only crawl specific domains
    DomainFilter(
        allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
        blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
    ),

    # Only include specific content types
    ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        filter_chain=filter_chain
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.3 Available Filter Types

Crawl4AI includes several specialized filters:

* **`URLPatternFilter`**: Matches URL patterns using wildcard syntax
* **`DomainFilter`**: Controls which domains to include or exclude
* **`ContentTypeFilter`**: Filters based on HTTP Content-Type
* **`ContentRelevanceFilter`**: Uses similarity to a text query
* **`SEOFilter`**: Evaluates SEO elements (meta tags, headers, etc.)

## 5. Using Scorers for Prioritized Crawling

Scorers assign priority values to discovered URLs, helping the crawler focus on the most relevant content first.

### 5.1 KeywordRelevanceScorer

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy

# Create a keyword relevance scorer
keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7  # Importance of this scorer (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        url_scorer=keyword_scorer
    ),
    stream=True  # Recommended with BestFirstCrawling
)

# Results will come in order of relevance score
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
        print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")
Copy
```

**How scorers work:**
- Evaluate each discovered URL before crawling
- Calculate relevance based on various signals
- Help the crawler make intelligent choices about traversal order

---

## 6. Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 6.1 SEO Filter for Quality Assessment

The **SEOFilter** helps you identify pages with strong SEO characteristics:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, SEOFilter

# Create an SEO filter that looks for specific keywords in page metadata
seo_filter = SEOFilter(
    threshold=0.5,  # Minimum score (0.0 to 1.0)
    keywords=["tutorial", "guide", "documentation"]
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([seo_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 6.2 Content Relevance Filter

The **ContentRelevanceFilter** analyzes the actual content of pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, ContentRelevanceFilter

# Create a content relevance filter
relevance_filter = ContentRelevanceFilter(
    query="Web crawling and data extraction with Python",
    threshold=0.7  # Minimum similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([relevance_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

This filter:
- Measures semantic similarity between query and page content
- It's a BM25-based relevance filter using head section content

---

## 7. Building a Complete Advanced Crawler

This example combines multiple techniques for a sophisticated crawl:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    DomainFilter,
    URLPatternFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

async def run_advanced_crawler():
    # Create a sophisticated filter chain
    filter_chain = FilterChain([
        # Domain boundaries
        DomainFilter(
            allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
            blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
        ),

        # URL patterns to include
        URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*", "*blog*"]),

        # Content type filtering
        ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
    ])

    # Create a relevance scorer
    keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
        keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
        weight=0.7
    )

    # Set up the configuration
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
            max_depth=2,
            include_external=False,
            filter_chain=filter_chain,
            url_scorer=keyword_scorer
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        stream=True,
        verbose=True
    )

    # Execute the crawl
    results = []
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
            results.append(result)
            score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
            depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
            print(f"Depth: {depth} | Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")

    # Analyze the results
    print(f"Crawled {len(results)} high-value pages")
    print(f"Average score: {sum(r.metadata.get('score', 0) for r in results) / len(results):.2f}")

    # Group by depth
    depth_counts = {}
    for result in results:
        depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
        depth_counts[depth] = depth_counts.get(depth, 0) + 1

    print("Pages crawled by depth:")
    for depth, count in sorted(depth_counts.items()):
        print(f"  Depth {depth}: {count} pages")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_advanced_crawler())
Copy
```

---

## 8. Limiting and Controlling Crawl Size

### 8.1 Using max\_pages

You can limit the total number of pages crawled with the `max_pages` parameter:

```
# Limit to exactly 20 pages regardless of depth
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=3,
    max_pages=20
)
Copy
```

This feature is useful for:
- Controlling API costs
- Setting predictable execution times
- Focusing on the most important content
- Testing crawl configurations before full execution

### 8.2 Using score\_threshold

For BFS and DFS strategies, you can set a minimum score threshold to only crawl high-quality pages:

```
# Only follow links with scores above 0.4
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    url_scorer=KeywordRelevanceScorer(keywords=["api", "guide", "reference"]),
    score_threshold=0.4  # Skip URLs with scores below this value
)
Copy
```

Note that for BestFirstCrawlingStrategy, score\_threshold is not needed since pages are already processed in order of highest score first.

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Tips

1.**Set realistic limits.** Be cautious with `max_depth` values > 3, which can exponentially increase crawl size. Use `max_pages` to set hard limits.

2.**Don't neglect the scoring component.** BestFirstCrawling works best with well-tuned scorers. Experiment with keyword weights for optimal prioritization.

3.**Be a good web citizen.** Respect robots.txt. (disabled by default)

4.**Handle page errors gracefully.** Not all pages will be accessible. Check `result.status` when processing results.

5.**Balance breadth vs. depth.** Choose your strategy wisely - BFS for comprehensive coverage, DFS for deep exploration, BestFirst for focused relevance-based crawling.

---

## 10. Summary & Next Steps

In this **Deep Crawling with Crawl4AI** tutorial, you learned to:

* Configure **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, and **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy**
* Process results in streaming or non-streaming mode
* Apply filters to target specific content
* Use scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages
* Limit crawls with `max_pages` and `score_threshold` parameters
* Build a complete advanced crawler with combined techniques

With these tools, you can efficiently extract structured data from websites at scale, focusing precisely on the content you need for your specific use case.

# Adaptive Web Crawling

## Introduction

Traditional web crawlers follow predetermined patterns, crawling pages blindly without knowing when they've gathered enough information. **Adaptive Crawling** changes this paradigm by introducing intelligence into the crawling process.

Think of it like research: when you're looking for information, you don't read every book in the library. You stop when you've found sufficient information to answer your question. That's exactly what Adaptive Crawling does for web scraping.

## Key Concepts

### The Problem It Solves

When crawling websites for specific information, you face two challenges:
1. **Under-crawling**: Stopping too early and missing crucial information
2. **Over-crawling**: Wasting resources by crawling irrelevant pages

Adaptive Crawling solves both by using a three-layer scoring system that determines when you have "enough" information.

### How It Works

The AdaptiveCrawler uses three metrics to measure information sufficiency:

* **Coverage**: How well your collected pages cover the query terms
* **Consistency**: Whether the information is coherent across pages
* **Saturation**: Detecting when new pages aren't adding new information

When these metrics indicate sufficient information has been gathered, crawling stops automatically.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, AdaptiveCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Create an adaptive crawler (config is optional)
        adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)

        # Start crawling with a query
        result = await adaptive.digest(
            start_url="
            query="async context managers"
        )

        # View statistics
        adaptive.print_stats()

        # Get the most relevant content
        relevant_pages = adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=5)
        for page in relevant_pages:
            print(f"- {page['url']} (score: {page['score']:.2f})")
Copy
```

### Configuration Options

```
from crawl4ai import AdaptiveConfig

config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.8,    # Stop when 80% confident (default: 0.7)
    max_pages=30,               # Maximum pages to crawl (default: 20)
    top_k_links=5,              # Links to follow per page (default: 3)
    min_gain_threshold=0.05     # Minimum expected gain to continue (default: 0.1)
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
Copy
```

## Crawling Strategies

Adaptive Crawling supports two distinct strategies for determining information sufficiency:

### Statistical Strategy (Default)

The statistical strategy uses pure information theory and term-based analysis:

* **Fast and efficient** - No API calls or model loading
* **Term-based coverage** - Analyzes query term presence and distribution
* **No external dependencies** - Works offline
* **Best for**: Well-defined queries with specific terminology

```
# Default configuration uses statistical strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="statistical",  # This is the default
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)
Copy
```

### Embedding Strategy

The embedding strategy uses semantic embeddings for deeper understanding:

* **Semantic understanding** - Captures meaning beyond exact term matches
* **Query expansion** - Automatically generates query variations
* **Gap-driven selection** - Identifies semantic gaps in knowledge
* **Validation-based stopping** - Uses held-out queries to validate coverage
* **Best for**: Complex queries, ambiguous topics, conceptual understanding

```
# Configure embedding strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",  # Default
    n_query_variations=10,  # Generate 10 query variations
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1  # Stop if completely irrelevant
)

# With custom embedding provider (e.g., OpenAI)
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_llm_config={
        'provider': 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
        'api_token': 'your-api-key'
    }
)
Copy
```

### Strategy Comparison

| Feature | Statistical | Embedding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Moderate (API calls) |
| **Cost** | Free | Depends on provider |
| **Accuracy** | Good for exact terms | Excellent for concepts |
| **Dependencies** | None | Embedding model/API |
| **Query Understanding** | Literal | Semantic |
| **Best Use Case** | Technical docs, specific terms | Research, broad topics |

### Embedding Strategy Configuration

The embedding strategy offers fine-tuned control through several parameters:

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",

    # Model configuration
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    embedding_llm_config=None,  # Use for API-based embeddings

    # Query expansion
    n_query_variations=10,  # Number of query variations to generate

    # Coverage parameters
    embedding_coverage_radius=0.2,  # Distance threshold for coverage
    embedding_k_exp=3.0,  # Exponential decay factor (higher = stricter)

    # Stopping criteria
    embedding_min_relative_improvement=0.1,  # Min improvement to continue
    embedding_validation_min_score=0.3,  # Min validation score
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1,  # Below this = irrelevant

    # Link selection
    embedding_overlap_threshold=0.85,  # Similarity for deduplication

    # Display confidence mapping
    embedding_quality_min_confidence=0.7,  # Min displayed confidence
    embedding_quality_max_confidence=0.95  # Max displayed confidence
)
Copy
```

### Handling Irrelevant Queries

The embedding strategy can detect when a query is completely unrelated to the content:

```
# This will stop quickly with low confidence
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="how to cook pasta"  # Irrelevant to Python docs
)

# Check if query was irrelevant
if result.metrics.get('is_irrelevant', False):
    print("Query is unrelated to the content!")
Copy
```

## When to Use Adaptive Crawling

### Perfect For:

* **Research Tasks**: Finding comprehensive information about a topic
* **Question Answering**: Gathering sufficient context to answer specific queries
* **Knowledge Base Building**: Creating focused datasets for AI/ML applications
* **Competitive Intelligence**: Collecting complete information about specific products/features

### Not Recommended For:

* **Full Site Archiving**: When you need every page regardless of content
* **Structured Data Extraction**: When targeting specific, known page patterns
* **Real-time Monitoring**: When you need continuous updates

## Understanding the Output

### Confidence Score

The confidence score (0-1) indicates how sufficient the gathered information is:
- **0.0-0.3**: Insufficient information, needs more crawling
- **0.3-0.6**: Partial information, may answer basic queries
- **0.6-0.7**: Good coverage, can answer most queries
- **0.7-1.0**: Excellent coverage, comprehensive information

### Statistics Display

```
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=False)  # Summary table
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=True)   # Detailed metrics
Copy
```

The summary shows:
- Pages crawled vs. confidence achieved
- Coverage, consistency, and saturation scores
- Crawling efficiency metrics

## Persistence and Resumption

### Saving Progress

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    save_state=True,
    state_path="my_crawl_state.json"
)

# Crawl will auto-save progress
result = await adaptive.digest(start_url, query)
Copy
```

### Resuming a Crawl

```
# Resume from saved state
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url,
    query,
    resume_from="my_crawl_state.json"
)
Copy
```

### Exporting Knowledge Base

```
# Export collected pages to JSONL
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")

# Import into another session
new_adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)
new_adaptive.import_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")
Copy
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Query Formulation

* Use specific, descriptive queries
* Include key terms you expect to find
* Avoid overly broad queries

### 2. Threshold Tuning

* Start with default (0.7) for general use
* Lower to 0.5-0.6 for exploratory crawling
* Raise to 0.8+ for exhaustive coverage

### 3. Performance Optimization

* Use appropriate `max_pages` limits
* Adjust `top_k_links` based on site structure
* Enable caching for repeat crawls

### 4. Link Selection

* The crawler prioritizes links based on:
* Relevance to query
* Expected information gain
* URL structure and depth

## Examples

### Research Assistant

```
# Gather information about a programming concept
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="python decorators implementation patterns"
)

# Get the most relevant excerpts
for doc in adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=3):
    print(f"\nFrom: {doc['url']}")
    print(f"Relevance: {doc['score']:.2%}")
    print(doc['content'][:500] + "...")
Copy
```

### Knowledge Base Builder

```
# Build a focused knowledge base about machine learning
queries = [
    "supervised learning algorithms",
    "neural network architectures", 
    "model evaluation metrics"
]

for query in queries:
    await adaptive.digest(
        start_url="
        query=query
    )

# Export combined knowledge base
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("ml_knowledge.jsonl")
Copy
```

### API Documentation Crawler

```
# Intelligently crawl API documentation
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.85,  # Higher threshold for completeness
    max_pages=30
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="authentication endpoints rate limits"
)
Copy
```

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from traditional crawling?**
A: Traditional crawling follows fixed patterns (BFS/DFS). Adaptive crawling makes intelligent decisions about which links to follow and when to stop based on information gain.

**Q: Can I use this with JavaScript-heavy sites?**
A: Yes! AdaptiveCrawler inherits all capabilities from AsyncWebCrawler, including JavaScript execution.

**Q: How does it handle large websites?**
A: The algorithm naturally limits crawling to relevant sections. Use `max_pages` as a safety limit.

**Q: Can I customize the scoring algorithms?**
A: Advanced users can implement custom strategies. See [Adaptive Strategies](../../advanced/adaptive-strategies/).

# Getting Started with Crawl4AI

Welcome to **Crawl4AI**, an open-source LLM-friendly Web Crawler & Scraper. In this tutorial, you’ll:

1. Run your **first crawl** using minimal configuration.
2. Generate **Markdown** output (and learn how it’s influenced by content filters).
3. Experiment with a simple **CSS-based extraction** strategy.
4. See a glimpse of **LLM-based extraction** (including open-source and closed-source model options).
5. Crawl a **dynamic** page that loads content via JavaScript.

---

## 1. Introduction

Crawl4AI provides:

* An asynchronous crawler, **`AsyncWebCrawler`**.
* Configurable browser and run settings via **`BrowserConfig`** and **`CrawlerRunConfig`**.
* Automatic HTML-to-Markdown conversion via **`DefaultMarkdownGenerator`** (supports optional filters).
* Multiple extraction strategies (LLM-based or “traditional” CSS/XPath-based).

By the end of this guide, you’ll have performed a basic crawl, generated Markdown, tried out two extraction strategies, and crawled a dynamic page that uses “Load More” buttons or JavaScript updates.

---

## 2. Your First Crawl

Here’s a minimal Python script that creates an **`AsyncWebCrawler`**, fetches a webpage, and prints the first 300 characters of its Markdown output:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("
        print(result.markdown[:300])  # Print first 300 chars

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**What’s happening?**
- **`AsyncWebCrawler`** launches a headless browser (Chromium by default).
- It fetches `
- Crawl4AI automatically converts the HTML into Markdown.

You now have a simple, working crawl!

---

## 3. Basic Configuration (Light Introduction)

Crawl4AI’s crawler can be heavily customized using two main classes:

1. **`BrowserConfig`**: Controls browser behavior (headless or full UI, user agent, JavaScript toggles, etc.).  
2. **`CrawlerRunConfig`**: Controls how each crawl runs (caching, extraction, timeouts, hooking, etc.).

Below is an example with minimal usage:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_conf = BrowserConfig(headless=True)  # or False to see the browser
    run_conf = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_conf) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_conf
        )
        print(result.markdown)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

> IMPORTANT: By default cache mode is set to `CacheMode.ENABLED`. So to have fresh content, you need to set it to `CacheMode.BYPASS`

We’ll explore more advanced config in later tutorials (like enabling proxies, PDF output, multi-tab sessions, etc.). For now, just note how you pass these objects to manage crawling.

---

## 4. Generating Markdown Output

By default, Crawl4AI automatically generates Markdown from each crawled page. However, the exact output depends on whether you specify a **markdown generator** or **content filter**.

* **`result.markdown`**:  
  The direct HTML-to-Markdown conversion.
* **`result.markdown.fit_markdown`**:  
  The same content after applying any configured **content filter** (e.g., `PruningContentFilter`).

### Example: Using a Filter with `DefaultMarkdownGenerator`

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import PruningContentFilter
from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator

md_generator = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
    content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.4, threshold_type="fixed")
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
    markdown_generator=md_generator
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(" config=config)
    print("Raw Markdown length:", len(result.markdown.raw_markdown))
    print("Fit Markdown length:", len(result.markdown.fit_markdown))
Copy
```

**Note**: If you do **not** specify a content filter or markdown generator, you’ll typically see only the raw Markdown. `PruningContentFilter` may adds around `50ms` in processing time. We’ll dive deeper into these strategies in a dedicated **Markdown Generation** tutorial.

## 5. Simple Data Extraction (CSS-based)

Crawl4AI can also extract structured data (JSON) using CSS or XPath selectors. Below is a minimal CSS-based example:

> **New!** Crawl4AI now provides a powerful utility to automatically generate extraction schemas using LLM. This is a one-time cost that gives you a reusable schema for fast, LLM-free extractions:

```
from crawl4ai import JsonCssExtractionStrategy
from crawl4ai import LLMConfig

# Generate a schema (one-time cost)
html = "<div class='product'><h2>Gaming Laptop</h2><span class='price'>$999.99</span></div>"

# Using OpenAI (requires API token)
schema = JsonCssExtractionStrategy.generate_schema(
    html,
    llm_config = LLMConfig(provider="openai/gpt-4o",api_token="your-openai-token")  # Required for OpenAI
)

# Or using Ollama (open source, no token needed)
schema = JsonCssExtractionStrategy.generate_schema(
    html,
    llm_config = LLMConfig(provider="ollama/llama3.3", api_token=None)  # Not needed for Ollama
)

# Use the schema for fast, repeated extractions
strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
Copy
```

For a complete guide on schema generation and advanced usage, see [No-LLM Extraction Strategies](../../extraction/no-llm-strategies/).

Here's a basic extraction example:

```
import asyncio
import json
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def main():
    schema = {
        "name": "Example Items",
        "baseSelector": "div.item",
        "fields": [
            {"name": "title", "selector": "h2", "type": "text"},
            {"name": "link", "selector": "a", "type": "attribute", "attribute": "href"}
        ]
    }

    raw_html = "<div class='item'><h2>Item 1</h2><a href=' 1</a></div>"

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="raw://" + raw_html,
            config=CrawlerRunConfig(
                cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
                extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
            )
        )
        # The JSON output is stored in 'extracted_content'
        data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**Why is this helpful?**
- Great for repetitive page structures (e.g., item listings, articles).
- No AI usage or costs.
- The crawler returns a JSON string you can parse or store.

> Tips: You can pass raw HTML to the crawler instead of a URL. To do so, prefix the HTML with `raw://`.

---

## 6. Simple Data Extraction (LLM-based)

For more complex or irregular pages, a language model can parse text intelligently into a structure you define. Crawl4AI supports **open-source** or **closed-source** providers:

* **Open-Source Models** (e.g., `ollama/llama3.3`, `no_token`)
* **OpenAI Models** (e.g., `openai/gpt-4`, requires `api_token`)
* Or any provider supported by the underlying library

Below is an example using **open-source** style (no token) and closed-source:

```
import os
import json
import asyncio
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, LLMConfig
from crawl4ai import LLMExtractionStrategy

class OpenAIModelFee(BaseModel):
    model_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the OpenAI model.")
    input_fee: str = Field(..., description="Fee for input token for the OpenAI model.")
    output_fee: str = Field(
        ..., description="Fee for output token for the OpenAI model."
    )

async def extract_structured_data_using_llm(
    provider: str, api_token: str = None, extra_headers: Dict[str, str] = None
):
    print(f"\n--- Extracting Structured Data with {provider} ---")

    if api_token is None and provider != "ollama":
        print(f"API token is required for {provider}. Skipping this example.")
        return

    browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=True)

    extra_args = {"temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.9, "max_tokens": 2000}
    if extra_headers:
        extra_args["extra_headers"] = extra_headers

    crawler_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        word_count_threshold=1,
        page_timeout=80000,
        extraction_strategy=LLMExtractionStrategy(
            llm_config = LLMConfig(provider=provider,api_token=api_token),
            schema=OpenAIModelFee.model_json_schema(),
            extraction_type="schema",
            instruction="""From the crawled content, extract all mentioned model names along with their fees for input and output tokens. 
            Do not miss any models in the entire content.""",
            extra_args=extra_args,
        ),
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url=" config=crawler_config
        )
        print(result.extracted_content)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    asyncio.run(
        extract_structured_data_using_llm(
            provider="openai/gpt-4o", api_token=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        )
    )
Copy
```

**What’s happening?**
- We define a Pydantic schema (`PricingInfo`) describing the fields we want.
- The LLM extraction strategy uses that schema and your instructions to transform raw text into structured JSON.
- Depending on the **provider** and **api\_token**, you can use local models or a remote API.

## 7. Adaptive Crawling (New!)

Crawl4AI now includes intelligent adaptive crawling that automatically determines when sufficient information has been gathered. Here's a quick example:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, AdaptiveCrawler

async def adaptive_example():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)

        # Start adaptive crawling
        result = await adaptive.digest(
            start_url="
            query="async context managers"
        )

        # View results
        adaptive.print_stats()
        print(f"Crawled {len(result.crawled_urls)} pages")
        print(f"Achieved {adaptive.confidence:.0%} confidence")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(adaptive_example())
Copy
```

**What's special about adaptive crawling?**
- **Automatic stopping**: Stops when sufficient information is gathered
- **Intelligent link selection**: Follows only relevant links
- **Confidence scoring**: Know how complete your information is

## 8. Multi-URL Concurrency (Preview)

If you need to crawl multiple URLs in **parallel**, you can use `arun_many()`. By default, Crawl4AI employs a **MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher**, automatically adjusting concurrency based on system resources. Here’s a quick glimpse:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def quick_parallel_example():
    urls = [
        "
        "
        "
    ]

    run_conf = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        stream=True  # Enable streaming mode
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Stream results as they complete
        async for result in await crawler.arun_many(urls, config=run_conf):
            if result.success:
                print(f"[OK] {result.url}, length: {len(result.markdown.raw_markdown)}")
            else:
                print(f"[ERROR] {result.url} => {result.error_message}")

        # Or get all results at once (default behavior)
        run_conf = run_conf.clone(stream=False)
        results = await crawler.arun_many(urls, config=run_conf)
        for res in results:
            if res.success:
                print(f"[OK] {res.url}, length: {len(res.markdown.raw_markdown)}")
            else:
                print(f"[ERROR] {res.url} => {res.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(quick_parallel_example())
Copy
```

The example above shows two ways to handle multiple URLs:
1. **Streaming mode** (`stream=True`): Process results as they become available using `async for`
2. **Batch mode** (`stream=False`): Wait for all results to complete

For more advanced concurrency (e.g., a **semaphore-based** approach, **adaptive memory usage throttling**, or customized rate limiting), see [Advanced Multi-URL Crawling](../../advanced/multi-url-crawling/).

---

## 8. Dynamic Content Example

Some sites require multiple “page clicks” or dynamic JavaScript updates. Below is an example showing how to **click** a “Next Page” button and wait for new commits to load on GitHub, using **`BrowserConfig`** and **`CrawlerRunConfig`**:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def extract_structured_data_using_css_extractor():
    print("\n--- Using JsonCssExtractionStrategy for Fast Structured Output ---")
    schema = {
        "name": "KidoCode Courses",
        "baseSelector": "section.charge-methodology .w-tab-content > div",
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "section_title",
                "selector": "h3.heading-50",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "section_description",
                "selector": ".charge-content",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "course_name",
                "selector": ".text-block-93",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "course_description",
                "selector": ".course-content-text",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "course_icon",
                "selector": ".image-92",
                "type": "attribute",
                "attribute": "src",
            },
        ],
    }

    browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=True, java_script_enabled=True)

    js_click_tabs = """
    (async () => {
        const tabs = document.querySelectorAll("section.charge-methodology .tabs-menu-3 > div");
        for(let tab of tabs) {
            tab.scrollIntoView();
            tab.click();
            await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 500));
        }
    })();
    """

    crawler_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema),
        js_code=[js_click_tabs],
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url=" config=crawler_config
        )

        companies = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(f"Successfully extracted {len(companies)} companies")
        print(json.dumps(companies[0], indent=2))

async def main():
    await extract_structured_data_using_css_extractor()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**Key Points**:

* **`BrowserConfig(headless=False)`**: We want to watch it click “Next Page.”
* **`CrawlerRunConfig(...)`**: We specify the extraction strategy, pass `session_id` to reuse the same page.
* **`js_code`** and **`wait_for`** are used for subsequent pages (`page > 0`) to click the “Next” button and wait for new commits to load.
* **`js_only=True`** indicates we’re not re-navigating but continuing the existing session.
* Finally, we call `kill_session()` to clean up the page and browser session.

# Deep Crawling

One of Crawl4AI's most powerful features is its ability to perform **configurable deep crawling** that can explore websites beyond a single page. With fine-tuned control over crawl depth, domain boundaries, and content filtering, Crawl4AI gives you the tools to extract precisely the content you need.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

1. How to set up a **Basic Deep Crawler** with BFS strategy
2. Understanding the difference between **streamed and non-streamed** output
3. Implementing **filters and scorers** to target specific content
4. Creating **advanced filtering chains** for sophisticated crawls
5. Using **BestFirstCrawling** for intelligent exploration prioritization

> **Prerequisites**  
> - You’ve completed or read [AsyncWebCrawler Basics](../simple-crawling/) to understand how to run a simple crawl.  
> - You know how to configure `CrawlerRunConfig`.

---

## 1. Quick Example

Here's a minimal code snippet that implements a basic deep crawl using the **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy

async def main():
    # Configure a 2-level deep crawl
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
            max_depth=2, 
            include_external=False
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        verbose=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

        print(f"Crawled {len(results)} pages in total")

        # Access individual results
        for result in results[:3]:  # Show first 3 results
            print(f"URL: {result.url}")
            print(f"Depth: {result.metadata.get('depth', 0)}")

**What's happening?**  
- `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=2, include_external=False)` instructs Crawl4AI to:
- Crawl the starting page (depth 0) plus 2 more levels
- Stay within the same domain (don't follow external links)
- Each result contains metadata like the crawl depth
- Results are returned as a list after all crawling is complete

---

## 2. Understanding Deep Crawling Strategy Options

### 2.1 BFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Breadth-First Search)

The **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a breadth-first approach, exploring all links at one depth before moving deeper:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=50,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.3,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.2 DFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Depth-First Search)

The **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a depth-first approach, explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import DFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=30,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.5,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.3 BestFirstCrawlingStrategy (⭐️ - Recommended Deep crawl strategy)

For more intelligent crawling, use **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy** with scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

# Create a scorer
scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7
)

# Configure the strategy
strategy = BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    include_external=False,
    url_scorer=scorer,
    max_pages=25,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
)
Copy
```

This crawling approach:
- Evaluates each discovered URL based on scorer criteria
- Visits higher-scoring pages first
- Helps focus crawl resources on the most relevant content
- Can limit total pages crawled with `max_pages`
- Does not need `score_threshold` as it naturally prioritizes by score

---

## 3. Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Results

Crawl4AI can return results in two modes:

### 3.1 Non-Streaming Mode (Default)

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=False  # Default behavior
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Wait for ALL results to be collected before returning
    results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

    for result in results:
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**When to use non-streaming mode:**
- You need the complete dataset before processing
- You're performing batch operations on all results together
- Crawl time isn't a critical factor

### 3.2 Streaming Mode

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=True  # Enable streaming
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Returns an async iterator
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        # Process each result as it becomes available
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**Benefits of streaming mode:**
- Process results immediately as they're discovered
- Start working with early results while crawling continues
- Better for real-time applications or progressive display
- Reduces memory pressure when handling many pages

---

## 4. Filtering Content with Filter Chains

Filters help you narrow down which pages to crawl. Combine multiple filters using **FilterChain** for powerful targeting.

### 4.1 Basic URL Pattern Filter

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, URLPatternFilter

# Only follow URLs containing "blog" or "docs"
url_filter = URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*blog*", "*docs*"])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([url_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.2 Combining Multiple Filters

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    URLPatternFilter,
    DomainFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)

# Create a chain of filters
filter_chain = FilterChain([
    # Only follow URLs with specific patterns
    URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*"]),

    # Only crawl specific domains
    DomainFilter(
        allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
        blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
    ),

    # Only include specific content types
    ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        filter_chain=filter_chain
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.3 Available Filter Types

Crawl4AI includes several specialized filters:

* **`URLPatternFilter`**: Matches URL patterns using wildcard syntax
* **`DomainFilter`**: Controls which domains to include or exclude
* **`ContentTypeFilter`**: Filters based on HTTP Content-Type
* **`ContentRelevanceFilter`**: Uses similarity to a text query
* **`SEOFilter`**: Evaluates SEO elements (meta tags, headers, etc.)

---

## 5. Using Scorers for Prioritized Crawling

Scorers assign priority values to discovered URLs, helping the crawler focus on the most relevant content first.

### 5.1 KeywordRelevanceScorer

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy

# Create a keyword relevance scorer
keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7  # Importance of this scorer (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        url_scorer=keyword_scorer
    ),
    stream=True  # Recommended with BestFirstCrawling
)

# Results will come in order of relevance score
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
        print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")
Copy
```

**How scorers work:**
- Evaluate each discovered URL before crawling
- Calculate relevance based on various signals
- Help the crawler make intelligent choices about traversal order

---

## 6. Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 6.1 SEO Filter for Quality Assessment

The **SEOFilter** helps you identify pages with strong SEO characteristics:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, SEOFilter

# Create an SEO filter that looks for specific keywords in page metadata
seo_filter = SEOFilter(
    threshold=0.5,  # Minimum score (0.0 to 1.0)
    keywords=["tutorial", "guide", "documentation"]
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([seo_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 6.2 Content Relevance Filter

The **ContentRelevanceFilter** analyzes the actual content of pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, ContentRelevanceFilter

# Create a content relevance filter
relevance_filter = ContentRelevanceFilter(
    query="Web crawling and data extraction with Python",
    threshold=0.7  # Minimum similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([relevance_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

This filter:
- Measures semantic similarity between query and page content
- It's a BM25-based relevance filter using head section content

---

## 7. Building a Complete Advanced Crawler

This example combines multiple techniques for a sophisticated crawl:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    DomainFilter,
    URLPatternFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

async def run_advanced_crawler():
    # Create a sophisticated filter chain
    filter_chain = FilterChain([
        # Domain boundaries
        DomainFilter(
            allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
            blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
        ),

        # URL patterns to include
        URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*", "*blog*"]),

        # Content type filtering
        ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
    ])

    # Create a relevance scorer
    keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
        keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
        weight=0.7
    )

    # Set up the configuration
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
            max_depth=2,
            include_external=False,
            filter_chain=filter_chain,
            url_scorer=keyword_scorer
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        stream=True,
        verbose=True
    )

    # Execute the crawl
    results = []
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
            results.append(result)
            score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
            depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
            print(f"Depth: {depth} | Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")

    # Analyze the results
    print(f"Crawled {len(results)} high-value pages")
    print(f"Average score: {sum(r.metadata.get('score', 0) for r in results) / len(results):.2f}")

    # Group by depth
    depth_counts = {}
    for result in results:
        depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
        depth_counts[depth] = depth_counts.get(depth, 0) + 1

    print("Pages crawled by depth:")
    for depth, count in sorted(depth_counts.items()):
        print(f"  Depth {depth}: {count} pages")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_advanced_crawler())
Copy
```

---

## 8. Limiting and Controlling Crawl Size

### 8.1 Using max\_pages

You can limit the total number of pages crawled with the `max_pages` parameter:

```
# Limit to exactly 20 pages regardless of depth
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=3,
    max_pages=20
)
Copy
```

This feature is useful for:
- Controlling API costs
- Setting predictable execution times
- Focusing on the most important content
- Testing crawl configurations before full execution

### 8.2 Using score\_threshold

For BFS and DFS strategies, you can set a minimum score threshold to only crawl high-quality pages:

```
# Only follow links with scores above 0.4
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    url_scorer=KeywordRelevanceScorer(keywords=["api", "guide", "reference"]),
    score_threshold=0.4  # Skip URLs with scores below this value
)
Copy
```

Note that for BestFirstCrawlingStrategy, score\_threshold is not needed since pages are already processed in order of highest score first.

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Tips

1.**Set realistic limits.** Be cautious with `max_depth` values > 3, which can exponentially increase crawl size. Use `max_pages` to set hard limits.

2.**Don't neglect the scoring component.** BestFirstCrawling works best with well-tuned scorers. Experiment with keyword weights for optimal prioritization.

3.**Be a good web citizen.** Respect robots.txt. (disabled by default)

4.**Handle page errors gracefully.** Not all pages will be accessible. Check `result.status` when processing results.

5.**Balance breadth vs. depth.** Choose your strategy wisely - BFS for comprehensive coverage, DFS for deep exploration, BestFirst for focused relevance-based crawling.

## Error Handling Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Waits

```
# Bad - element might not be ready
CLICK `#button`

# Good - wait for element first
WAIT `#button` 5
CLICK `#button`
Copy
```

### 2. Handle Optional Elements

```
# Check before interacting
IF (EXISTS `.popup`) THEN CLICK `.close`
IF (EXISTS `.cookie-banner`) THEN CLICK `.accept`

# Then proceed with main flow
CLICK `#main-action`
Copy
```

### 3. Use Descriptive Variables

```
# Set up reusable data
SETVAR admin_email = "admin@company.com"
SETVAR test_password = "TestPass123!"
SETVAR staging_url = "

# Use throughout script
GO $staging_url
TYPE $admin_email
Copy
```

### 4. Add Debugging Information

```
# Log progress
EVAL `console.log("Starting login process")`
GO /login

# Verify page state
IF (`document.title.includes("Login")`) THEN EVAL `console.log("On login page")`

# Continue with login
TYPE $username
Copy
```

## Common Patterns

### Login Flow

```
# Complete login automation
SETVAR email = "user@example.com"
SETVAR password = "mypassword"

GO /login
WAIT `#login-form` 5

# Handle optional cookie banner
IF (EXISTS `.cookie-banner`) THEN CLICK `.accept-cookies`

# Fill and submit form
CLICK `#email`
TYPE $email
PRESS Tab
TYPE $password
CLICK `button[type="submit"]`

# Wait for redirect
WAIT `.dashboard` 10
Copy
```

### Infinite Scroll

```
# Load all content with infinite scroll
GO /products

# Scroll and load more content
REPEAT (SCROLL DOWN 500, `document.querySelector(".load-more")`)

# Alternative: Fixed number of scrolls
REPEAT (SCROLL DOWN 800, 10)
WAIT 2
Copy
```

### Form Validation

```
# Handle form with validation
SET `#email` "invalid-email"
CLICK `#submit`

# Check for validation error
IF (EXISTS `.error-email`) THEN SET `#email` "valid@example.com"

# Retry submission
CLICK `#submit`
WAIT `.success-message` 5
Copy
```

### Multi-step Process

```
# Complex multi-step workflow
PROC navigate_to_step
  CLICK `.next-button`
  WAIT `.step-content` 5
ENDPROC

# Step 1
WAIT `.step-1` 5
SET `#name` "John Doe"
navigate_to_step

# Step 2
SET `#email` "john@example.com"
navigate_to_step

# Step 3
CLICK `#submit-final`
WAIT `.confirmation` 10
Copy
```

## Integration with Crawl4AI

Use C4A-Script with Crawl4AI for dynamic content interaction:

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

# Define interaction script
script = """
# Handle dynamic content loading
WAIT `.content` 5
IF (EXISTS `.load-more-button`) THEN CLICK `.load-more-button`
WAIT `.additional-content` 5

# Accept cookies if needed
IF (EXISTS `.cookie-banner`) THEN CLICK `.accept-all`
"""

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    c4a_script=script,
    wait_for=".content",
    screenshot=True
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(" config=config)
    print(result.markdown)
Copy
```

# Adaptive Web Crawling

## Introduction

Traditional web crawlers follow predetermined patterns, crawling pages blindly without knowing when they've gathered enough information. **Adaptive Crawling** changes this paradigm by introducing intelligence into the crawling process.

Think of it like research: when you're looking for information, you don't read every book in the library. You stop when you've found sufficient information to answer your question. That's exactly what Adaptive Crawling does for web scraping.

## Key Concepts

### The Problem It Solves

When crawling websites for specific information, you face two challenges:
1. **Under-crawling**: Stopping too early and missing crucial information
2. **Over-crawling**: Wasting resources by crawling irrelevant pages

Adaptive Crawling solves both by using a three-layer scoring system that determines when you have "enough" information.

### How It Works

The AdaptiveCrawler uses three metrics to measure information sufficiency:

* **Coverage**: How well your collected pages cover the query terms
* **Consistency**: Whether the information is coherent across pages
* **Saturation**: Detecting when new pages aren't adding new information

When these metrics indicate sufficient information has been gathered, crawling stops automatically.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, AdaptiveCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Create an adaptive crawler (config is optional)
        adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)

        # Start crawling with a query
        result = await adaptive.digest(
            start_url="
            query="async context managers"
        )

        # View statistics
        adaptive.print_stats()

        # Get the most relevant content
        relevant_pages = adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=5)
        for page in relevant_pages:
            print(f"- {page['url']} (score: {page['score']:.2f})")
Copy
```

### Configuration Options

```
from crawl4ai import AdaptiveConfig

config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.8,    # Stop when 80% confident (default: 0.7)
    max_pages=30,               # Maximum pages to crawl (default: 20)
    top_k_links=5,              # Links to follow per page (default: 3)
    min_gain_threshold=0.05     # Minimum expected gain to continue (default: 0.1)
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
Copy
```

## Crawling Strategies

Adaptive Crawling supports two distinct strategies for determining information sufficiency:

### Statistical Strategy (Default)

The statistical strategy uses pure information theory and term-based analysis:

* **Fast and efficient** - No API calls or model loading
* **Term-based coverage** - Analyzes query term presence and distribution
* **No external dependencies** - Works offline
* **Best for**: Well-defined queries with specific terminology

```
# Default configuration uses statistical strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="statistical",  # This is the default
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)
Copy
```

### Embedding Strategy

The embedding strategy uses semantic embeddings for deeper understanding:

* **Semantic understanding** - Captures meaning beyond exact term matches
* **Query expansion** - Automatically generates query variations
* **Gap-driven selection** - Identifies semantic gaps in knowledge
* **Validation-based stopping** - Uses held-out queries to validate coverage
* **Best for**: Complex queries, ambiguous topics, conceptual understanding

```
# Configure embedding strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",  # Default
    n_query_variations=10,  # Generate 10 query variations
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1  # Stop if completely irrelevant
)

# With custom embedding provider (e.g., OpenAI)
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_llm_config={
        'provider': 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
        'api_token': 'your-api-key'
    }
)
Copy
```

### Strategy Comparison

| Feature | Statistical | Embedding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Moderate (API calls) |
| **Cost** | Free | Depends on provider |
| **Accuracy** | Good for exact terms | Excellent for concepts |
| **Dependencies** | None | Embedding model/API |
| **Query Understanding** | Literal | Semantic |
| **Best Use Case** | Technical docs, specific terms | Research, broad topics |

### Embedding Strategy Configuration

The embedding strategy offers fine-tuned control through several parameters:

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",

    # Model configuration
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    embedding_llm_config=None,  # Use for API-based embeddings

    # Query expansion
    n_query_variations=10,  # Number of query variations to generate

    # Coverage parameters
    embedding_coverage_radius=0.2,  # Distance threshold for coverage
    embedding_k_exp=3.0,  # Exponential decay factor (higher = stricter)

    # Stopping criteria
    embedding_min_relative_improvement=0.1,  # Min improvement to continue
    embedding_validation_min_score=0.3,  # Min validation score
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1,  # Below this = irrelevant

    # Link selection
    embedding_overlap_threshold=0.85,  # Similarity for deduplication

    # Display confidence mapping
    embedding_quality_min_confidence=0.7,  # Min displayed confidence
    embedding_quality_max_confidence=0.95  # Max displayed confidence
)
Copy
```

### Handling Irrelevant Queries

The embedding strategy can detect when a query is completely unrelated to the content:

```
# This will stop quickly with low confidence
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="how to cook pasta"  # Irrelevant to Python docs
)

# Check if query was irrelevant
if result.metrics.get('is_irrelevant', False):
    print("Query is unrelated to the content!")
Copy
```

## When to Use Adaptive Crawling

### Perfect For:

* **Research Tasks**: Finding comprehensive information about a topic
* **Question Answering**: Gathering sufficient context to answer specific queries
* **Knowledge Base Building**: Creating focused datasets for AI/ML applications
* **Competitive Intelligence**: Collecting complete information about specific products/features

### Not Recommended For:

* **Full Site Archiving**: When you need every page regardless of content
* **Structured Data Extraction**: When targeting specific, known page patterns
* **Real-time Monitoring**: When you need continuous updates

## Understanding the Output

### Confidence Score

The confidence score (0-1) indicates how sufficient the gathered information is:
- **0.0-0.3**: Insufficient information, needs more crawling
- **0.3-0.6**: Partial information, may answer basic queries
- **0.6-0.7**: Good coverage, can answer most queries
- **0.7-1.0**: Excellent coverage, comprehensive information

### Statistics Display

```
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=False)  # Summary table
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=True)   # Detailed metrics
Copy
```

The summary shows:
- Pages crawled vs. confidence achieved
- Coverage, consistency, and saturation scores
- Crawling efficiency metrics

## Persistence and Resumption

### Saving Progress

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    save_state=True,
    state_path="my_crawl_state.json"
)

# Crawl will auto-save progress
result = await adaptive.digest(start_url, query)
Copy
```

### Resuming a Crawl

```
# Resume from saved state
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url,
    query,
    resume_from="my_crawl_state.json"
)
Copy
```

### Exporting Knowledge Base

```
# Export collected pages to JSONL
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")

# Import into another session
new_adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)
new_adaptive.import_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")
Copy
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Query Formulation

* Use specific, descriptive queries
* Include key terms you expect to find
* Avoid overly broad queries

### 2. Threshold Tuning

* Start with default (0.7) for general use
* Lower to 0.5-0.6 for exploratory crawling
* Raise to 0.8+ for exhaustive coverage

### 3. Performance Optimization

* Use appropriate `max_pages` limits
* Adjust `top_k_links` based on site structure
* Enable caching for repeat crawls

### 4. Link Selection

* The crawler prioritizes links based on:
* Relevance to query
* Expected information gain
* URL structure and depth

## Examples

### Research Assistant

```
# Gather information about a programming concept
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="python decorators implementation patterns"
)

# Get the most relevant excerpts
for doc in adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=3):
    print(f"\nFrom: {doc['url']}")
    print(f"Relevance: {doc['score']:.2%}")
    print(doc['content'][:500] + "...")
Copy
```

### Knowledge Base Builder

```
# Build a focused knowledge base about machine learning
queries = [
    "supervised learning algorithms",
    "neural network architectures", 
    "model evaluation metrics"
]

for query in queries:
    await adaptive.digest(
        start_url="
        query=query
    )

# Export combined knowledge base
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("ml_knowledge.jsonl")
Copy
```

### API Documentation Crawler

```
# Intelligently crawl API documentation
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.85,  # Higher threshold for completeness
    max_pages=30
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="authentication endpoints rate limits"
)
Copy
```

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from traditional crawling?**
A: Traditional crawling follows fixed patterns (BFS/DFS). Adaptive crawling makes intelligent decisions about which links to follow and when to stop based on information gain.

**Q: Can I use this with JavaScript-heavy sites?**
A: Yes! AdaptiveCrawler inherits all capabilities from AsyncWebCrawler, including JavaScript execution.

**Q: How does it handle large websites?**
A: The algorithm naturally limits crawling to relevant sections. Use `max_pages` as a safety limit.

**Q: Can I customize the scoring algorithms?**
A: Advanced users can implement custom strategies. See [Adaptive Strategies](../../advanced/adaptive-strategies/).

# Simple Crawling

This guide covers the basics of web crawling with Crawl4AI. You'll learn how to set up a crawler, make your first request, and understand the response.

## Basic Usage

Set up a simple crawl using `BrowserConfig` and `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig()  # Default browser configuration
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()   # Default crawl run configuration

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )
        print(result.markdown)  # Print clean markdown content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

## Understanding the Response

The `arun()` method returns a `CrawlResult` object with several useful properties. Here's a quick overview (see [CrawlResult](../../api/crawl-result/) for complete details):

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
        content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.6),
        options={"ignore_links": True}
    )
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=config
)

# Different content formats
print(result.html)         # Raw HTML
print(result.cleaned_html) # Cleaned HTML
print(result.markdown.raw_markdown) # Raw markdown from cleaned html
print(result.markdown.fit_markdown) # Most relevant content in markdown

# Check success status
print(result.success)      # True if crawl succeeded
print(result.status_code)  # HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404)

# Access extracted media and links
print(result.media)        # Dictionary of found media (images, videos, audio)
print(result.links)        # Dictionary of internal and external links
Copy
```

## Adding Basic Options

Customize your crawl using `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    word_count_threshold=10,        # Minimum words per content block
    exclude_external_links=True,    # Remove external links
    remove_overlay_elements=True,   # Remove popups/modals
    process_iframes=True           # Process iframe content
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=run_config
)
Copy
```

## Handling Errors

Always check if the crawl was successful:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)

if not result.success:
    print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
    print(f"Status code: {result.status_code}")
Copy
```

## Logging and Debugging

Enable verbose logging in `BrowserConfig`:

```
browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)

async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
    result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)
Copy
```

## Complete Example

Here's a more comprehensive example demonstrating common usage patterns:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Content filtering
        word_count_threshold=10,
        excluded_tags=['form', 'header'],
        exclude_external_links=True,

        # Content processing
        process_iframes=True,
        remove_overlay_elements=True,

        # Cache control
        cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED  # Use cache if available
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )

        if result.success:
            # Print clean content
            print("Content:", result.markdown[:500])  # First 500 chars

            # Process images
            for image in result.media["images"]:
                print(f"Found image: {image['src']}")

            # Process links
            for link in result.links["internal"]:
                print(f"Internal link: {link['href']}")

        else:
            print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

# Getting Started with Crawl4AI

Welcome to **Crawl4AI**, an open-source LLM-friendly Web Crawler & Scraper. In this tutorial, you’ll:

1. Run your **first crawl** using minimal configuration.
2. Generate **Markdown** output (and learn how it’s influenced by content filters).
3. Experiment with a simple **CSS-based extraction** strategy.
4. See a glimpse of **LLM-based extraction** (including open-source and closed-source model options).
5. Crawl a **dynamic** page that loads content via JavaScript.

---

## 1. Introduction

Crawl4AI provides:

* An asynchronous crawler, **`AsyncWebCrawler`**.
* Configurable browser and run settings via **`BrowserConfig`** and **`CrawlerRunConfig`**.
* Automatic HTML-to-Markdown conversion via **`DefaultMarkdownGenerator`** (supports optional filters).
* Multiple extraction strategies (LLM-based or “traditional” CSS/XPath-based).

By the end of this guide, you’ll have performed a basic crawl, generated Markdown, tried out two extraction strategies, and crawled a dynamic page that uses “Load More” buttons or JavaScript updates.

---

## 2. Your First Crawl

Here’s a minimal Python script that creates an **`AsyncWebCrawler`**, fetches a webpage, and prints the first 300 characters of its Markdown output:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("
        print(result.markdown[:300])  # Print first 300 chars

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**What’s happening?**
- **`AsyncWebCrawler`** launches a headless browser (Chromium by default).
- It fetches `
- Crawl4AI automatically converts the HTML into Markdown.

You now have a simple, working crawl!

---

## 3. Basic Configuration (Light Introduction)

Crawl4AI’s crawler can be heavily customized using two main classes:

1. **`BrowserConfig`**: Controls browser behavior (headless or full UI, user agent, JavaScript toggles, etc.).  
2. **`CrawlerRunConfig`**: Controls how each crawl runs (caching, extraction, timeouts, hooking, etc.).

Below is an example with minimal usage:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_conf = BrowserConfig(headless=True)  # or False to see the browser
    run_conf = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_conf) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_conf
        )
        print(result.markdown)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

> IMPORTANT: By default cache mode is set to `CacheMode.ENABLED`. So to have fresh content, you need to set it to `CacheMode.BYPASS`

We’ll explore more advanced config in later tutorials (like enabling proxies, PDF output, multi-tab sessions, etc.). For now, just note how you pass these objects to manage crawling.

---

## 4. Generating Markdown Output

By default, Crawl4AI automatically generates Markdown from each crawled page. However, the exact output depends on whether you specify a **markdown generator** or **content filter**.

* **`result.markdown`**:  
  The direct HTML-to-Markdown conversion.
* **`result.markdown.fit_markdown`**:  
  The same content after applying any configured **content filter** (e.g., `PruningContentFilter`).

### Example: Using a Filter with `DefaultMarkdownGenerator`

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import PruningContentFilter
from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator

md_generator = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
    content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.4, threshold_type="fixed")
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
    markdown_generator=md_generator
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(" config=config)
    print("Raw Markdown length:", len(result.markdown.raw_markdown))
    print("Fit Markdown length:", len(result.markdown.fit_markdown))
Copy
```

**Note**: If you do **not** specify a content filter or markdown generator, you’ll typically see only the raw Markdown. `PruningContentFilter` may adds around `50ms` in processing time. We’ll dive deeper into these strategies in a dedicated **Markdown Generation** tutorial.

---

## 5. Simple Data Extraction (CSS-based)

Crawl4AI can also extract structured data (JSON) using CSS or XPath selectors. Below is a minimal CSS-based example:

> **New!** Crawl4AI now provides a powerful utility to automatically generate extraction schemas using LLM. This is a one-time cost that gives you a reusable schema for fast, LLM-free extractions:

```
from crawl4ai import JsonCssExtractionStrategy
from crawl4ai import LLMConfig

# Generate a schema (one-time cost)
html = "<div class='product'><h2>Gaming Laptop</h2><span class='price'>$999.99</span></div>"

# Using OpenAI (requires API token)
schema = JsonCssExtractionStrategy.generate_schema(
    html,
    llm_config = LLMConfig(provider="openai/gpt-4o",api_token="your-openai-token")  # Required for OpenAI
)

# Or using Ollama (open source, no token needed)
schema = JsonCssExtractionStrategy.generate_schema(
    html,
    llm_config = LLMConfig(provider="ollama/llama3.3", api_token=None)  # Not needed for Ollama
)

# Use the schema for fast, repeated extractions
strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
Copy
```

For a complete guide on schema generation and advanced usage, see [No-LLM Extraction Strategies](../../extraction/no-llm-strategies/).

Here's a basic extraction example:

```
import asyncio
import json
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def main():
    schema = {
        "name": "Example Items",
        "baseSelector": "div.item",
        "fields": [
            {"name": "title", "selector": "h2", "type": "text"},
            {"name": "link", "selector": "a", "type": "attribute", "attribute": "href"}
        ]
    }

    raw_html = "<div class='item'><h2>Item 1</h2><a href=' 1</a></div>"

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="raw://" + raw_html,
            config=CrawlerRunConfig(
                cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
                extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
            )
        )
        # The JSON output is stored in 'extracted_content'
        data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**Why is this helpful?**
- Great for repetitive page structures (e.g., item listings, articles).
- No AI usage or costs.
- The crawler returns a JSON string you can parse or store.

> Tips: You can pass raw HTML to the crawler instead of a URL. To do so, prefix the HTML with `raw://`.

---

## 6. Simple Data Extraction (LLM-based)

For more complex or irregular pages, a language model can parse text intelligently into a structure you define. Crawl4AI supports **open-source** or **closed-source** providers:

* **Open-Source Models** (e.g., `ollama/llama3.3`, `no_token`)
* **OpenAI Models** (e.g., `openai/gpt-4`, requires `api_token`)
* Or any provider supported by the underlying library

Below is an example using **open-source** style (no token) and closed-source:

```
import os
import json
import asyncio
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, LLMConfig
from crawl4ai import LLMExtractionStrategy

class OpenAIModelFee(BaseModel):
    model_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the OpenAI model.")
    input_fee: str = Field(..., description="Fee for input token for the OpenAI model.")
    output_fee: str = Field(
        ..., description="Fee for output token for the OpenAI model."
    )

async def extract_structured_data_using_llm(
    provider: str, api_token: str = None, extra_headers: Dict[str, str] = None
):
    print(f"\n--- Extracting Structured Data with {provider} ---")

    if api_token is None and provider != "ollama":
        print(f"API token is required for {provider}. Skipping this example.")
        return

    browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=True)

    extra_args = {"temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.9, "max_tokens": 2000}
    if extra_headers:
        extra_args["extra_headers"] = extra_headers

    crawler_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        word_count_threshold=1,
        page_timeout=80000,
        extraction_strategy=LLMExtractionStrategy(
            llm_config = LLMConfig(provider=provider,api_token=api_token),
            schema=OpenAIModelFee.model_json_schema(),
            extraction_type="schema",
            instruction="""From the crawled content, extract all mentioned model names along with their fees for input and output tokens. 
            Do not miss any models in the entire content.""",
            extra_args=extra_args,
        ),
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url=" config=crawler_config
        )
        print(result.extracted_content)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    asyncio.run(
        extract_structured_data_using_llm(
            provider="openai/gpt-4o", api_token=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        )
    )
Copy
```

**What’s happening?**
- We define a Pydantic schema (`PricingInfo`) describing the fields we want.
- The LLM extraction strategy uses that schema and your instructions to transform raw text into structured JSON.
- Depending on the **provider** and **api\_token**, you can use local models or a remote API.

---

## 7. Adaptive Crawling (New!)

Crawl4AI now includes intelligent adaptive crawling that automatically determines when sufficient information has been gathered. Here's a quick example:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, AdaptiveCrawler

async def adaptive_example():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)

        # Start adaptive crawling
        result = await adaptive.digest(
            start_url="
            query="async context managers"
        )

        # View results
        adaptive.print_stats()
        print(f"Crawled {len(result.crawled_urls)} pages")
        print(f"Achieved {adaptive.confidence:.0%} confidence")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(adaptive_example())
Copy
```

**What's special about adaptive crawling?**
- **Automatic stopping**: Stops when sufficient information is gathered
- **Intelligent link selection**: Follows only relevant links
- **Confidence scoring**: Know how complete your information is

## 8. Multi-URL Concurrency (Preview)

If you need to crawl multiple URLs in **parallel**, you can use `arun_many()`. By default, Crawl4AI employs a **MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher**, automatically adjusting concurrency based on system resources. Here’s a quick glimpse:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def quick_parallel_example():
    urls = [
        "
        "
        "
    ]

    run_conf = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        stream=True  # Enable streaming mode
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Stream results as they complete
        async for result in await crawler.arun_many(urls, config=run_conf):
            if result.success:
                print(f"[OK] {result.url}, length: {len(result.markdown.raw_markdown)}")
            else:
                print(f"[ERROR] {result.url} => {result.error_message}")

        # Or get all results at once (default behavior)
        run_conf = run_conf.clone(stream=False)
        results = await crawler.arun_many(urls, config=run_conf)
        for res in results:
            if res.success:
                print(f"[OK] {res.url}, length: {len(res.markdown.raw_markdown)}")
            else:
                print(f"[ERROR] {res.url} => {res.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(quick_parallel_example())
Copy
```

The example above shows two ways to handle multiple URLs:
1. **Streaming mode** (`stream=True`): Process results as they become available using `async for`
2. **Batch mode** (`stream=False`): Wait for all results to complete

For more advanced concurrency (e.g., a **semaphore-based** approach, **adaptive memory usage throttling**, or customized rate limiting), see [Advanced Multi-URL Crawling](../../advanced/multi-url-crawling/).

---

## 8. Dynamic Content Example

Some sites require multiple “page clicks” or dynamic JavaScript updates. Below is an example showing how to **click** a “Next Page” button and wait for new commits to load on GitHub, using **`BrowserConfig`** and **`CrawlerRunConfig`**:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def extract_structured_data_using_css_extractor():
    print("\n--- Using JsonCssExtractionStrategy for Fast Structured Output ---")
    schema = {
        "name": "KidoCode Courses",
        "baseSelector": "section.charge-methodology .w-tab-content > div",
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "section_title",
                "selector": "h3.heading-50",
                "type": "text",

            {
                "name": "section_description",
                "selector": ".charge-content",

                "selector": ".course-content-text",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "course_icon",
                "selector": ".image-92",
                "type": "attribute",
                "attribute": "src",
            },
        ],
    }

    browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=True, java_script_enabled=True)

    js_click_tabs = """
    (async () => {
        const tabs = document.querySelectorAll("section.charge-methodology .tabs-menu-3 > div");
        for(let tab of tabs) {

```

**Key Points**:

* **`BrowserConfig(headless=False)`**: We want to watch it click “Next Page.”
* **`CrawlerRunConfig(...)`**: We specify the extraction strategy, pass `session_id` to reuse the same page.
* **`js_code`** and **`wait_for`** are used for subsequent pages (`page > 0`) to click the “Next” button and wait for new commits to load.
* **`js_only=True`** indicates we’re not re-navigating but continuing the existing session.
* Finally, we call `kill_session()` to clean up the page and browser session.

# Simple Crawling

This guide covers the basics of web crawling with Crawl4AI. You'll learn how to set up a crawler, make your first request, and understand the response.

## Basic Usage

Set up a simple crawl using `BrowserConfig` and `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig()  # Default browser configuration
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()   # Default crawl run configuration

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )
        print(result.markdown)  # Print clean markdown content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

## Understanding the Response

The `arun()` method returns a `CrawlResult` object with several useful properties. Here's a quick overview (see [CrawlResult](../../api/crawl-result/) for complete details):

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
        content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.6),
        options={"ignore_links": True}
    )
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=config
)

# Different content formats
print(result.html)         # Raw HTML
print(result.cleaned_html) # Cleaned HTML
print(result.markdown.raw_markdown) # Raw markdown from cleaned html
print(result.markdown.fit_markdown) # Most relevant content in markdown

# Check success status
print(result.success)      # True if crawl succeeded
print(result.status_code)  # HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404)

# Access extracted media and links
print(result.media)        # Dictionary of found media (images, videos, audio)
print(result.links)        # Dictionary of internal and external links
Copy
```

## Adding Basic Options

Customize your crawl using `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    word_count_threshold=10,        # Minimum words per content block
    exclude_external_links=True,    # Remove external links
    remove_overlay_elements=True,   # Remove popups/modals
    process_iframes=True           # Process iframe content
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=run_config
)
Copy
```

## Handling Errors

Always check if the crawl was successful:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)

if not result.success:
    print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
    print(f"Status code: {result.status_code}")
Copy
```

## Logging and Debugging

Enable verbose logging in `BrowserConfig`:

```
browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)

async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
    result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)
Copy
```

## Complete Example

Here's a more comprehensive example demonstrating common usage patterns:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Content filtering
        word_count_threshold=10,
        excluded_tags=['form', 'header'],
        exclude_external_links=True,

        # Content processing
        process_iframes=True,
        remove_overlay_elements=True,

        # Cache control
        cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED  # Use cache if available
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )

        if result.success:
            # Print clean content
            print("Content:", result.markdown[:500])  # First 500 chars

            # Process images
            for image in result.media["images"]:
                print(f"Found image: {image['src']}")

            # Process links
            for link in result.links["internal"]:
                print(f"Internal link: {link['href']}")

        else:
            print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy

# Adaptive Web Crawling

## Introduction

Traditional web crawlers follow predetermined patterns, crawling pages blindly without knowing when they've gathered enough information. **Adaptive Crawling** changes this paradigm by introducing intelligence into the crawling process.

Think of it like research: when you're looking for information, you don't read every book in the library. You stop when you've found sufficient information to answer your question. That's exactly what Adaptive Crawling does for web scraping.

## Key Concepts

### The Problem It Solves

When crawling websites for specific information, you face two challenges:
1. **Under-crawling**: Stopping too early and missing crucial information
2. **Over-crawling**: Wasting resources by crawling irrelevant pages

Adaptive Crawling solves both by using a three-layer scoring system that determines when you have "enough" information.

### How It Works

The AdaptiveCrawler uses three metrics to measure information sufficiency:

* **Coverage**: How well your collected pages cover the query terms
* **Consistency**: Whether the information is coherent across pages
* **Saturation**: Detecting when new pages aren't adding new information

When these metrics indicate sufficient information has been gathered, crawling stops automatically.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, AdaptiveCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Create an adaptive crawler (config is optional)
        adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)

        # Start crawling with a query
        result = await adaptive.digest(
            start_url="
            query="async context managers"
        )

        # View statistics
        adaptive.print_stats()

        # Get the most relevant content
        relevant_pages = adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=5)
        for page in relevant_pages:
            print(f"- {page['url']} (score: {page['score']:.2f})")
Copy
```

### Configuration Options

```
from crawl4ai import AdaptiveConfig

config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.8,    # Stop when 80% confident (default: 0.7)
    max_pages=30,               # Maximum pages to crawl (default: 20)
    top_k_links=5,              # Links to follow per page (default: 3)
    min_gain_threshold=0.05     # Minimum expected gain to continue (default: 0.1)
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
Copy
```

## Crawling Strategies

Adaptive Crawling supports two distinct strategies for determining information sufficiency:

### Statistical Strategy (Default)

The statistical strategy uses pure information theory and term-based analysis:

* **Fast and efficient** - No API calls or model loading
* **Term-based coverage** - Analyzes query term presence and distribution
* **No external dependencies** - Works offline
* **Best for**: Well-defined queries with specific terminology

```
# Default configuration uses statistical strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="statistical",  # This is the default
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)
Copy
```

### Embedding Strategy

The embedding strategy uses semantic embeddings for deeper understanding:

* **Semantic understanding** - Captures meaning beyond exact term matches
* **Query expansion** - Automatically generates query variations
* **Gap-driven selection** - Identifies semantic gaps in knowledge
* **Validation-based stopping** - Uses held-out queries to validate coverage
* **Best for**: Complex queries, ambiguous topics, conceptual understanding

```
# Configure embedding strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",  # Default
    n_query_variations=10,  # Generate 10 query variations
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1  # Stop if completely irrelevant
)

# With custom embedding provider (e.g., OpenAI)
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_llm_config={
        'provider': 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
        'api_token': 'your-api-key'
    }
)
Copy
```

### Strategy Comparison

| Feature | Statistical | Embedding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Moderate (API calls) |
| **Cost** | Free | Depends on provider |
| **Accuracy** | Good for exact terms | Excellent for concepts |
| **Dependencies** | None | Embedding model/API |
| **Query Understanding** | Literal | Semantic |
| **Best Use Case** | Technical docs, specific terms | Research, broad topics |

### Embedding Strategy Configuration

The embedding strategy offers fine-tuned control through several parameters:

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",

    # Model configuration
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    embedding_llm_config=None,  # Use for API-based embeddings

    # Query expansion
    n_query_variations=10,  # Number of query variations to generate

    # Coverage parameters
    embedding_coverage_radius=0.2,  # Distance threshold for coverage
    embedding_k_exp=3.0,  # Exponential decay factor (higher = stricter)

    # Stopping criteria
    embedding_min_relative_improvement=0.1,  # Min improvement to continue
    embedding_validation_min_score=0.3,  # Min validation score
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1,  # Below this = irrelevant

    # Link selection
    embedding_overlap_threshold=0.85,  # Similarity for deduplication

    # Display confidence mapping
    embedding_quality_min_confidence=0.7,  # Min displayed confidence
    embedding_quality_max_confidence=0.95  # Max displayed confidence
)
Copy
```

### Handling Irrelevant Queries

The embedding strategy can detect when a query is completely unrelated to the content:

```
# This will stop quickly with low confidence
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="how to cook pasta"  # Irrelevant to Python docs
)

# Check if query was irrelevant
if result.metrics.get('is_irrelevant', False):
    print("Query is unrelated to the content!")
Copy
```

## When to Use Adaptive Crawling

### Perfect For:

* **Research Tasks**: Finding comprehensive information about a topic
* **Question Answering**: Gathering sufficient context to answer specific queries
* **Knowledge Base Building**: Creating focused datasets for AI/ML applications
* **Competitive Intelligence**: Collecting complete information about specific products/features

### Not Recommended For:

* **Full Site Archiving**: When you need every page regardless of content
* **Structured Data Extraction**: When targeting specific, known page patterns
* **Real-time Monitoring**: When you need continuous updates

## Understanding the Output

### Confidence Score

The confidence score (0-1) indicates how sufficient the gathered information is:
- **0.0-0.3**: Insufficient information, needs more crawling
- **0.3-0.6**: Partial information, may answer basic queries
- **0.6-0.7**: Good coverage, can answer most queries
- **0.7-1.0**: Excellent coverage, comprehensive information

### Statistics Display

```
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=False)  # Summary table
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=True)   # Detailed metrics
Copy
```

The summary shows:
- Pages crawled vs. confidence achieved
- Coverage, consistency, and saturation scores
- Crawling efficiency metrics

## Persistence and Resumption

### Saving Progress

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    save_state=True,
    state_path="my_crawl_state.json"
)

# Crawl will auto-save progress
result = await adaptive.digest(start_url, query)
Copy
```

### Resuming a Crawl

```
# Resume from saved state
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url,
    query,
    resume_from="my_crawl_state.json"
)
Copy
```

### Exporting Knowledge Base

```
# Export collected pages to JSONL
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")

# Import into another session
new_adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)
new_adaptive.import_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")
Copy
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Query Formulation

* Use specific, descriptive queries
* Include key terms you expect to find
* Avoid overly broad queries

### 2. Threshold Tuning

* Start with default (0.7) for general use
* Lower to 0.5-0.6 for exploratory crawling
* Raise to 0.8+ for exhaustive coverage

### 3. Performance Optimization

* Use appropriate `max_pages` limits
* Adjust `top_k_links` based on site structure
* Enable caching for repeat crawls

### 4. Link Selection

* The crawler prioritizes links based on:
* Relevance to query
* Expected information gain
* URL structure and depth

## Examples

### Research Assistant

```
# Gather information about a programming concept
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="python decorators implementation patterns"
)

# Get the most relevant excerpts

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from traditional crawling?**
A: Traditional crawling follows fixed patterns (BFS/DFS). Adaptive crawling makes intelligent decisions about which links to follow and when to stop based on information gain.

**Q: Can I use this with JavaScript-heavy sites?**
A: Yes! AdaptiveCrawler inherits all capabilities from AsyncWebCrawler, including JavaScript execution.

**Q: How does it handle large websites?**
A: The algorithm naturally limits crawling to relevant sections. Use `max_pages` as a safety limit.

**Q: Can I customize the scoring algorithms?**
A: Advanced users can implement custom strategies. See [Adaptive Strategies](../../advanced/adaptive-strategies/).

# Deep Crawling

One of Crawl4AI's most powerful features is its ability to perform **configurable deep crawling** that can explore websites beyond a single page. With fine-tuned control over crawl depth, domain boundaries, and content filtering, Crawl4AI gives you the tools to extract precisely the content you need.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

1. How to set up a **Basic Deep Crawler** with BFS strategy
2. Understanding the difference between **streamed and non-streamed** output
3. Implementing **filters and scorers** to target specific content
4. Creating **advanced filtering chains** for sophisticated crawls
5. Using **BestFirstCrawling** for intelligent exploration prioritization

> **Prerequisites**  
> - You’ve completed or read [AsyncWebCrawler Basics](../simple-crawling/) to understand how to run a simple crawl.  
> - You know how to configure `CrawlerRunConfig`.

---

## 1. Quick Example

Here's a minimal code snippet that implements a basic deep crawl using the **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy

async def main():
    # Configure a 2-level deep crawl
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
            max_depth=2, 
            include_external=False
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        verbose=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

        print(f"Crawled {len(results)} pages in total")

        # Access individual results
        for result in results[:3]:  # Show first 3 results
            print(f"URL: {result.url}")
            print(f"Depth: {result.metadata.get('depth', 0)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**What's happening?**  
- `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=2, include_external=False)` instructs Crawl4AI to:
- Crawl the starting page (depth 0) plus 2 more levels
- Stay within the same domain (don't follow external links)
- Each result contains metadata like the crawl depth
- Results are returned as a list after all crawling is complete

---

## 2. Understanding Deep Crawling Strategy Options

### 2.1 BFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Breadth-First Search)

The **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a breadth-first approach, exploring all links at one depth before moving deeper:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=50,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.3,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.2 DFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Depth-First Search)

The **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a depth-first approach, explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import DFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=30,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.5,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.3 BestFirstCrawlingStrategy (⭐️ - Recommended Deep crawl strategy)

For more intelligent crawling, use **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy** with scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

# Create a scorer
scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7
)

# Configure the strategy
strategy = BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    include_external=False,
    url_scorer=scorer,
    max_pages=25,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
)
Copy
```

This crawling approach:
- Evaluates each discovered URL based on scorer criteria
- Visits higher-scoring pages first
- Helps focus crawl resources on the most relevant content
- Can limit total pages crawled with `max_pages`
- Does not need `score_threshold` as it naturally prioritizes by score

---

## 3. Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Results

Crawl4AI can return results in two modes:

### 3.1 Non-Streaming Mode (Default)

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=False  # Default behavior
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Wait for ALL results to be collected before returning
    results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

    for result in results:
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**When to use non-streaming mode:**
- You need the complete dataset before processing
- You're performing batch operations on all results together
- Crawl time isn't a critical factor

### 3.2 Streaming Mode

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=True  # Enable streaming
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Returns an async iterator
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        # Process each result as it becomes available
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**Benefits of streaming mode:**
- Process results immediately as they're discovered
- Start working with early results while crawling continues
- Better for real-time applications or progressive display
- Reduces memory pressure when handling many pages

---

## 4. Filtering Content with Filter Chains

Filters help you narrow down which pages to crawl. Combine multiple filters using **FilterChain** for powerful targeting.

### 4.1 Basic URL Pattern Filter

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, URLPatternFilter

# Only follow URLs containing "blog" or "docs"
url_filter = URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*blog*", "*docs*"])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([url_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.2 Combining Multiple Filters

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    URLPatternFilter,
    DomainFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)

# Create a chain of filters
filter_chain = FilterChain([
    # Only follow URLs with specific patterns
    URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*"]),

    # Only crawl specific domains
    DomainFilter(
        allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
        blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
    ),

    # Only include specific content types
    ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        filter_chain=filter_chain
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.3 Available Filter Types

Crawl4AI includes several specialized filters:

* **`URLPatternFilter`**: Matches URL patterns using wildcard syntax
* **`DomainFilter`**: Controls which domains to include or exclude
* **`ContentTypeFilter`**: Filters based on HTTP Content-Type
* **`ContentRelevanceFilter`**: Uses similarity to a text query
* **`SEOFilter`**: Evaluates SEO elements (meta tags, headers, etc.)

---

## 5. Using Scorers for Prioritized Crawling

Scorers assign priority values to discovered URLs, helping the crawler focus on the most relevant content first.

### 5.1 KeywordRelevanceScorer

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy

# Create a keyword relevance scorer
keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7  # Importance of this scorer (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        url_scorer=keyword_scorer
    ),
    stream=True  # Recommended with BestFirstCrawling
)

# Results will come in order of relevance score
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
        print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")
Copy
```

**How scorers work:**
- Evaluate each discovered URL before crawling
- Calculate relevance based on various signals
- Help the crawler make intelligent choices about traversal order

---

## 6. Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 6.1 SEO Filter for Quality Assessment

The **SEOFilter** helps you identify pages with strong SEO characteristics:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, SEOFilter

# Create an SEO filter that looks for specific keywords in page metadata
seo_filter = SEOFilter(
    threshold=0.5,  # Minimum score (0.0 to 1.0)
    keywords=["tutorial", "guide", "documentation"]
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([seo_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 6.2 Content Relevance Filter

The **ContentRelevanceFilter** analyzes the actual content of pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, ContentRelevanceFilter

# Create a content relevance filter
relevance_filter = ContentRelevanceFilter(
    query="Web crawling and data extraction with Python",
    threshold=0.7  # Minimum similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([relevance_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

This filter:
- Measures semantic similarity between query and page content
- It's a BM25-based relevance filter using head section content

---

## 7. Building a Complete Advanced Crawler

This example combines multiple techniques for a sophisticated crawl:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    DomainFilter,
    URLPatternFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

async def run_advanced_crawler():
    # Create a sophisticated filter chain
    filter_chain = FilterChain([
        # Domain boundaries
        DomainFilter(
            allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
            blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
        ),

        # URL patterns to include
        URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*", "*blog*"]),

        # Content type filtering
        ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
    ])

    # Create a relevance scorer
    keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
        keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
        weight=0.7
    )

    # Set up the configuration
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
            max_depth=2,
            include_external=False,
            filter_chain=filter_chain,
            url_scorer=keyword_scorer
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        stream=True,
        verbose=True
    )

    # Execute the crawl
    results = []
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
            results.append(result)
            score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
            depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
            print(f"Depth: {depth} | Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")

    # Analyze the results
    print(f"Crawled {len(results)} high-value pages")
    print(f"Average score: {sum(r.metadata.get('score', 0) for r in results) / len(results):.2f}")

    # Group by depth
    depth_counts = {}
    for result in results:
        depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
        depth_counts[depth] = depth_counts.get(depth, 0) + 1

    print("Pages crawled by depth:")
    for depth, count in sorted(depth_counts.items()):
        print(f"  Depth {depth}: {count} pages")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_advanced_crawler())
Copy
```

---

## 8. Limiting and Controlling Crawl Size

### 8.1 Using max\_pages

You can limit the total number of pages crawled with the `max_pages` parameter:

```
# Limit to exactly 20 pages regardless of depth
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=3,
    max_pages=20
)
Copy
```

This feature is useful for:
- Controlling API costs
- Setting predictable execution times
- Focusing on the most important content
- Testing crawl configurations before full execution

### 8.2 Using score\_threshold

For BFS and DFS strategies, you can set a minimum score threshold to only crawl high-quality pages:

```
# Only follow links with scores above 0.4
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    url_scorer=KeywordRelevanceScorer(keywords=["api", "guide", "reference"]),
    score_threshold=0.4  # Skip URLs with scores below this value
)
Copy
```

Note that for BestFirstCrawlingStrategy, score\_threshold is not needed since pages are already processed in order of highest score first.

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Tips

1.**Set realistic limits.** Be cautious with `max_depth` values > 3, which can exponentially increase crawl size. Use `max_pages` to set hard limits.

2.**Don't neglect the scoring component.** BestFirstCrawling works best with well-tuned scorers. Experiment with keyword weights for optimal prioritization.

3.**Be a good web citizen.** Respect robots.txt. (disabled by default)

4.**Handle page errors gracefully.** Not all pages will be accessible. Check `result.status` when processing results.

5.**Balance breadth vs. depth.** Choose your strategy wisely - BFS for comprehensive coverage, DFS for deep exploration, BestFirst for focused relevance-based crawling.

---

## 10. Summary & Next Steps

In this **Deep Crawling with Crawl4AI** tutorial, you learned to:

* Configure **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, and **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy**
* Process results in streaming or non-streaming mode
* Apply filters to target specific content
* Use scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages
* Limit crawls with `max_pages` and `score_threshold` parameters
* Build a complete advanced crawler with combined techniques

With these tools, you can efficiently extract structured data from websites at scale, focusing precisely on the content you need for your specific use case.

# Simple Crawling

This guide covers the basics of web crawling with Crawl4AI. You'll learn how to set up a crawler, make your first request, and understand the response.

## Basic Usage

Set up a simple crawl using `BrowserConfig` and `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig()  # Default browser configuration
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()   # Default crawl run configuration

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )
        print(result.markdown)  # Print clean markdown content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

## Understanding the Response

The `arun()` method returns a `CrawlResult` object with several useful properties. Here's a quick overview (see [CrawlResult](../../api/crawl-result/) for complete details):

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
        content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.6),
        options={"ignore_links": True}
    )
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=config
)

# Different content formats
print(result.html)         # Raw HTML
print(result.cleaned_html) # Cleaned HTML
print(result.markdown.raw_markdown) # Raw markdown from cleaned html
print(result.markdown.fit_markdown) # Most relevant content in markdown

# Check success status
print(result.success)      # True if crawl succeeded
print(result.status_code)  # HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404)

# Access extracted media and links
print(result.media)        # Dictionary of found media (images, videos, audio)
print(result.links)        # Dictionary of internal and external links
Copy
```

## Adding Basic Options

Customize your crawl using `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    word_count_threshold=10,        # Minimum words per content block
    exclude_external_links=True,    # Remove external links
    remove_overlay_elements=True,   # Remove popups/modals
    process_iframes=True           # Process iframe content
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=run_config
)
Copy
```

## Handling Errors

Always check if the crawl was successful:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)

if not result.success:
    print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
    print(f"Status code: {result.status_code}")
Copy
```

## Logging and Debugging

Enable verbose logging in `BrowserConfig`:

```
browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)

async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
    result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)
Copy
```

## Complete Example

Here's a more comprehensive example demonstrating common usage patterns:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Content filtering
        word_count_threshold=10,
        excluded_tags=['form', 'header'],
        exclude_external_links=True,

        # Content processing
        process_iframes=True,
        remove_overlay_elements=True,

        # Cache control
        cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED  # Use cache if available
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )

        if result.success:
            # Print clean content
            print("Content:", result.markdown[:500])  # First 500 chars

            # Process images
            for image in result.media["images"]:
                print(f"Found image: {image['src']}")

            # Process links
            for link in result.links["internal"]:
                print(f"Internal link: {link['href']}")

        else:
            print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

# Deep Crawling

One of Crawl4AI's most powerful features is its ability to perform **configurable deep crawling** that can explore websites beyond a single page. With fine-tuned control over crawl depth, domain boundaries, and content filtering, Crawl4AI gives you the tools to extract precisely the content you need.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

1. How to set up a **Basic Deep Crawler** with BFS strategy
2. Understanding the difference between **streamed and non-streamed** output
3. Implementing **filters and scorers** to target specific content
4. Creating **advanced filtering chains** for sophisticated crawls
5. Using **BestFirstCrawling** for intelligent exploration prioritization

> **Prerequisites**  
> - You’ve completed or read [AsyncWebCrawler Basics](../simple-crawling/) to understand how to run a simple crawl.  
> - You know how to configure `CrawlerRunConfig`.

---

## 1. Quick Example

Here's a minimal code snippet that implements a basic deep crawl using the **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy

async def main():
    # Configure a 2-level deep crawl
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
            max_depth=2, 
            include_external=False
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        verbose=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

        print(f"Crawled {len(results)} pages in total")

        # Access individual results
        for result in results[:3]:  # Show first 3 results
            print(f"URL: {result.url}")
            print(f"Depth: {result.metadata.get('depth', 0)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**What's happening?**  
- `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=2, include_external=False)` instructs Crawl4AI to:
- Crawl the starting page (depth 0) plus 2 more levels
- Stay within the same domain (don't follow external links)
- Each result contains metadata like the crawl depth
- Results are returned as a list after all crawling is complete

---

## 2. Understanding Deep Crawling Strategy Options

### 2.1 BFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Breadth-First Search)

The **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a breadth-first approach, exploring all links at one depth before moving deeper:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=50,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.3,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.2 DFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Depth-First Search)

The **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a depth-first approach, explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import DFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=30,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.5,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.3 BestFirstCrawlingStrategy (⭐️ - Recommended Deep crawl strategy)

For more intelligent crawling, use **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy** with scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

# Create a scorer
scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7
)

# Configure the strategy
strategy = BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    include_external=False,
    url_scorer=scorer,
    max_pages=25,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
)
Copy
```

This crawling approach:
- Evaluates each discovered URL based on scorer criteria
- Visits higher-scoring pages first
- Helps focus crawl resources on the most relevant content
- Can limit total pages crawled with `max_pages`
- Does not need `score_threshold` as it naturally prioritizes by score

---

## 3. Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Results

Crawl4AI can return results in two modes:

### 3.1 Non-Streaming Mode (Default)

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=False  # Default behavior
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Wait for ALL results to be collected before returning
    results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

    for result in results:
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**When to use non-streaming mode:**
- You need the complete dataset before processing
- You're performing batch operations on all results together
- Crawl time isn't a critical factor

### 3.2 Streaming Mode

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=True  # Enable streaming
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Returns an async iterator
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        # Process each result as it becomes available
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**Benefits of streaming mode:**
- Process results immediately as they're discovered
- Start working with early results while crawling continues
- Better for real-time applications or progressive display
- Reduces memory pressure when handling many pages

---

## 4. Filtering Content with Filter Chains

Filters help you narrow down which pages to crawl. Combine multiple filters using **FilterChain** for powerful targeting.

### 4.1 Basic URL Pattern Filter

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, URLPatternFilter

# Only follow URLs containing "blog" or "docs"
url_filter = URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*blog*", "*docs*"])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([url_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.2 Combining Multiple Filters

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    URLPatternFilter,
    DomainFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)

# Create a chain of filters
filter_chain = FilterChain([
    # Only follow URLs with specific patterns
    URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*"]),

    # Only crawl specific domains
    DomainFilter(
        allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
        blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
    ),

    # Only include specific content types
    ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        filter_chain=filter_chain
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.3 Available Filter Types

Crawl4AI includes several specialized filters:

* **`URLPatternFilter`**: Matches URL patterns using wildcard syntax
* **`DomainFilter`**: Controls which domains to include or exclude
* **`ContentTypeFilter`**: Filters based on HTTP Content-Type
* **`ContentRelevanceFilter`**: Uses similarity to a text query
* **`SEOFilter`**: Evaluates SEO elements (meta tags, headers, etc.)

---

## 5. Using Scorers for Prioritized Crawling

Scorers assign priority values to discovered URLs, helping the crawler focus on the most relevant content first.

### 5.1 KeywordRelevanceScorer

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy

# Create a keyword relevance scorer
keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7  # Importance of this scorer (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        url_scorer=keyword_scorer
    ),
    stream=True  # Recommended with BestFirstCrawling
)

# Results will come in order of relevance score
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
        print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")
Copy
```

**How scorers work:**
- Evaluate each discovered URL before crawling
- Calculate relevance based on various signals
- Help the crawler make intelligent choices about traversal order

---

## 6. Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 6.1 SEO Filter for Quality Assessment

The **SEOFilter** helps you identify pages with strong SEO characteristics:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, SEOFilter

# Create an SEO filter that looks for specific keywords in page metadata
seo_filter = SEOFilter(
    threshold=0.5,  # Minimum score (0.0 to 1.0)
    keywords=["tutorial", "guide", "documentation"]
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([seo_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 6.2 Content Relevance Filter

The **ContentRelevanceFilter** analyzes the actual content of pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, ContentRelevanceFilter

# Create a content relevance filter
relevance_filter = ContentRelevanceFilter(
    query="Web crawling and data extraction with Python",
    threshold=0.7  # Minimum similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([relevance_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

This filter:
- Measures semantic similarity between query and page content
- It's a BM25-based relevance filter using head section content

---

## 7. Building a Complete Advanced Crawler

This example combines multiple techniques for a sophisticated crawl:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    DomainFilter,
    URLPatternFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

async def run_advanced_crawler():
    # Create a sophisticated filter chain
    filter_chain = FilterChain([
        # Domain boundaries
        DomainFilter(
            allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
            blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
        ),

        # URL patterns to include
        URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*", "*blog*"]),

        # Content type filtering
        ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
    ])

    # Create a relevance scorer
    keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
        keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
        weight=0.7
    )

    # Set up the configuration
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
            max_depth=2,
            include_external=False,
            filter_chain=filter_chain,
            url_scorer=keyword_scorer
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        stream=True,
        verbose=True
    )

    # Execute the crawl
    results = []
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
            results.append(result)
            score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
            depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
            print(f"Depth: {depth} | Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")

    # Analyze the results
    print(f"Crawled {len(results)} high-value pages")
    print(f"Average score: {sum(r.metadata.get('score', 0) for r in results) / len(results):.2f}")

    # Group by depth
    depth_counts = {}
    for result in results:
        depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
        depth_counts[depth] = depth_counts.get(depth, 0) + 1

    print("Pages crawled by depth:")
    for depth, count in sorted(depth_counts.items()):
        print(f"  Depth {depth}: {count} pages")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_advanced_crawler())
Copy
```

---

## 8. Limiting and Controlling Crawl Size

### 8.1 Using max\_pages

You can limit the total number of pages crawled with the `max_pages` parameter:

```
# Limit to exactly 20 pages regardless of depth
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=3,
    max_pages=20
)
Copy
```

This feature is useful for:
- Controlling API costs
- Setting predictable execution times
- Focusing on the most important content
- Testing crawl configurations before full execution

### 8.2 Using score\_threshold

For BFS and DFS strategies, you can set a minimum score threshold to only crawl high-quality pages:

```
# Only follow links with scores above 0.4
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    url_scorer=KeywordRelevanceScorer(keywords=["api", "guide", "reference"]),
    score_threshold=0.4  # Skip URLs with scores below this value
)
Copy
```

Note that for BestFirstCrawlingStrategy, score\_threshold is not needed since pages are already processed in order of highest score first.

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Tips

1.**Set realistic limits.** Be cautious with `max_depth` values > 3, which can exponentially increase crawl size. Use `max_pages` to set hard limits.

2.**Don't neglect the scoring component.** BestFirstCrawling works best with well-tuned scorers. Experiment with keyword weights for optimal prioritization.

3.**Be a good web citizen.** Respect robots.txt. (disabled by default)

4.**Handle page errors gracefully.** Not all pages will be accessible. Check `result.status` when processing results.

# Adaptive Web Crawling

## Introduction

Traditional web crawlers follow predetermined patterns, crawling pages blindly without knowing when they've gathered enough information. **Adaptive Crawling** changes this paradigm by introducing intelligence into the crawling process.

Think of it like research: when you're looking for information, you don't read every book in the library. You stop when you've found sufficient information to answer your question. That's exactly what Adaptive Crawling does for web scraping.

## Key Concepts

### The Problem It Solves

When crawling websites for specific information, you face two challenges:
1. **Under-crawling**: Stopping too early and missing crucial information
2. **Over-crawling**: Wasting resources by crawling irrelevant pages

Adaptive Crawling solves both by using a three-layer scoring system that determines when you have "enough" information.

### How It Works

The AdaptiveCrawler uses three metrics to measure information sufficiency:

* **Coverage**: How well your collected pages cover the query terms
* **Consistency**: Whether the information is coherent across pages
* **Saturation**: Detecting when new pages aren't adding new information

When these metrics indicate sufficient information has been gathered, crawling stops automatically.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, AdaptiveCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Create an adaptive crawler (config is optional)
        adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)

        # Start crawling with a query
        result = await adaptive.digest(
            start_url="
            query="async context managers"
        )

        # View statistics
        adaptive.print_stats()

        # Get the most relevant content
        relevant_pages = adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=5)
        for page in relevant_pages:
            print(f"- {page['url']} (score: {page['score']:.2f})")
Copy
```

### Configuration Options

```
from crawl4ai import AdaptiveConfig

config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.8,    # Stop when 80% confident (default: 0.7)
    max_pages=30,               # Maximum pages to crawl (default: 20)
    top_k_links=5,              # Links to follow per page (default: 3)
    min_gain_threshold=0.05     # Minimum expected gain to continue (default: 0.1)
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
Copy
```

## Crawling Strategies

Adaptive Crawling supports two distinct strategies for determining information sufficiency:

### Statistical Strategy (Default)

The statistical strategy uses pure information theory and term-based analysis:

* **Fast and efficient** - No API calls or model loading
* **Term-based coverage** - Analyzes query term presence and distribution
* **No external dependencies** - Works offline
* **Best for**: Well-defined queries with specific terminology

```
# Default configuration uses statistical strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="statistical",  # This is the default
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)
Copy
```

### Embedding Strategy

The embedding strategy uses semantic embeddings for deeper understanding:

* **Semantic understanding** - Captures meaning beyond exact term matches
* **Query expansion** - Automatically generates query variations
* **Gap-driven selection** - Identifies semantic gaps in knowledge
* **Validation-based stopping** - Uses held-out queries to validate coverage
* **Best for**: Complex queries, ambiguous topics, conceptual understanding

```
# Configure embedding strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",  # Default
    n_query_variations=10,  # Generate 10 query variations
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1  # Stop if completely irrelevant
)

# With custom embedding provider (e.g., OpenAI)
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_llm_config={
        'provider': 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
        'api_token': 'your-api-key'
    }
)
Copy
```

### Strategy Comparison

| Feature | Statistical | Embedding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Moderate (API calls) |
| **Cost** | Free | Depends on provider |
| **Accuracy** | Good for exact terms | Excellent for concepts |
| **Dependencies** | None | Embedding model/API |
| **Query Understanding** | Literal | Semantic |
| **Best Use Case** | Technical docs, specific terms | Research, broad topics |

### Embedding Strategy Configuration

The embedding strategy offers fine-tuned control through several parameters:

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",

    # Model configuration
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    embedding_llm_config=None,  # Use for API-based embeddings

    # Query expansion
    n_query_variations=10,  # Number of query variations to generate

    # Coverage parameters
    embedding_coverage_radius=0.2,  # Distance threshold for coverage
    embedding_k_exp=3.0,  # Exponential decay factor (higher = stricter)

    # Stopping criteria
    embedding_min_relative_improvement=0.1,  # Min improvement to continue
    embedding_validation_min_score=0.3,  # Min validation score
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1,  # Below this = irrelevant

    # Link selection
    embedding_overlap_threshold=0.85,  # Similarity for deduplication

    # Display confidence mapping
    embedding_quality_min_confidence=0.7,  # Min displayed confidence
    embedding_quality_max_confidence=0.95  # Max displayed confidence
)
Copy
```

### Handling Irrelevant Queries

The embedding strategy can detect when a query is completely unrelated to the content:

```
# This will stop quickly with low confidence
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="how to cook pasta"  # Irrelevant to Python docs
)

# Check if query was irrelevant
if result.metrics.get('is_irrelevant', False):
    print("Query is unrelated to the content!")
Copy
```

## When to Use Adaptive Crawling

### Perfect For:

* **Research Tasks**: Finding comprehensive information about a topic
* **Question Answering**: Gathering sufficient context to answer specific queries
* **Knowledge Base Building**: Creating focused datasets for AI/ML applications
* **Competitive Intelligence**: Collecting complete information about specific products/features

### Not Recommended For:

* **Full Site Archiving**: When you need every page regardless of content
* **Structured Data Extraction**: When targeting specific, known page patterns
* **Real-time Monitoring**: When you need continuous updates

## Understanding the Output

### Confidence Score

The confidence score (0-1) indicates how sufficient the gathered information is:
- **0.0-0.3**: Insufficient information, needs more crawling
- **0.3-0.6**: Partial information, may answer basic queries
- **0.6-0.7**: Good coverage, can answer most queries
- **0.7-1.0**: Excellent coverage, comprehensive information

### Statistics Display

```
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=False)  # Summary table
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=True)   # Detailed metrics
Copy
```

The summary shows:
- Pages crawled vs. confidence achieved
- Coverage, consistency, and saturation scores
- Crawling efficiency metrics

## Persistence and Resumption

### Saving Progress

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    save_state=True,
    state_path="my_crawl_state.json"
)

# Crawl will auto-save progress
result = await adaptive.digest(start_url, query)
Copy
```

### Resuming a Crawl

```
# Resume from saved state
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url,
    query,
    resume_from="my_crawl_state.json"
)
Copy
```

### Exporting Knowledge Base

```
# Export collected pages to JSONL
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")

# Import into another session
new_adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)
new_adaptive.import_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")
Copy
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Query Formulation

* Use specific, descriptive queries
* Include key terms you expect to find
* Avoid overly broad queries

### 2. Threshold Tuning

* Start with default (0.7) for general use
* Lower to 0.5-0.6 for exploratory crawling
* Raise to 0.8+ for exhaustive coverage

### 3. Performance Optimization

* Use appropriate `max_pages` limits
* Adjust `top_k_links` based on site structure
* Enable caching for repeat crawls

### 4. Link Selection

* The crawler prioritizes links based on:
* Relevance to query
* Expected information gain
* URL structure and depth

## Examples

### Research Assistant

```
# Gather information about a programming concept
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="python decorators implementation patterns"
)

# Get the most relevant excerpts
for doc in adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=3):
    print(f"\nFrom: {doc['url']}")
    print(f"Relevance: {doc['score']:.2%}")
    print(doc['content'][:500] + "...")
Copy
```

### Knowledge Base Builder

```
# Build a focused knowledge base about machine learning
queries = [
    "supervised learning algorithms",
    "neural network architectures", 
    "model evaluation metrics"
]

for query in queries:
    await adaptive.digest(
        start_url="
        query=query
    )

# Export combined knowledge base
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("ml_knowledge.jsonl")
Copy
```

### API Documentation Crawler

```
# Intelligently crawl API documentation
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.85,  # Higher threshold for completeness
    max_pages=30
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="authentication endpoints rate limits"
)
Copy
```

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from traditional crawling?**
A: Traditional crawling follows fixed patterns (BFS/DFS). Adaptive crawling makes intelligent decisions about which links to follow and when to stop based on information gain.

**Q: Can I use this with JavaScript-heavy sites?**
A: Yes! AdaptiveCrawler inherits all capabilities from AsyncWebCrawler, including JavaScript execution.

**Q: How does it handle large websites?**
A: The algorithm naturally limits crawling to relevant sections. Use `max_pages` as a safety limit.

**Q: Can I customize the scoring algorithms?**
A: Advanced users can implement custom strategies. See [Adaptive Strategies](../../advanced/adaptive-strategies/).

  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.

Best of all, you have nothing to lose, since you can try out T-Mobile Home Internet first to make sure you find a plan that works for you.
* ### Do these plans come with 5-Year price guarantee?

  Yes, new and upgrading customers on the T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™ plans are covered by our 5- year price guarantee. 5-year price guarantee means that we won't change the price of fixed-wireless 5G internet data for at least 5 years while you are on an eligible plan. Taxes & fees, voluntary equipment or speed upgrades, future wireless generations, select limited-time promotions, per-use charges, third-party services, and network management practices aren't included. This guarantee starts when you activate or switch to an eligible plan and doesn't restart if you add a line or change plans after that.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.

  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.
* ### How fast is 5G home internet (in Mbps) compared to cable?

A sofa may be the most personal furniture in your home. This is especially true for VIMLE and SÖDERHAMN sofa series, as you can tailor them to your needs. The modular design adapts easily from small to large spaces – while changeable, washable covers and an attractive price tag make them ideal companions over time.

You are an expert assistant. Using only the current webpage content below, answer the user's question by quoting the relevant passage, code block, or table WORD-FOR-WORD, including ALL formatting, indentation, and line breaks. DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or shorten ANY part of the quoted answer, unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize giving the most detailed answer possible by quoting the all relevant text from the content. If the content has numbers, prices, code, tables, or other specific details, quote them exactly as they appear. If multiple relevant passages are found, include ALL of them in their entirety, word-for-word. ALWAYS provide which page they should visit to find the exact information they are looking for, if possible, by saying 'Please visit [page URL] for the full details.' If you cite information from a source, always include the full URL shown in the source.If no answer is found, summarize anything related, and politely inform the user that the answer does not appear to be present, suggest a related page by URL if present in the content. Do not hallucinate.At the end, write 'SUFFICIENT: YES' if the answer fully resolves the question, or 'SUFFICIENT: NO' if not. Write 'CONFIDENCE: <0-100>%, based on how confident you are that this answers the question fully'. Write 'Full info or more info: <URL>'

CONTENT:
# Simple Crawling

This guide covers the basics of web crawling with Crawl4AI. You'll learn how to set up a crawler, make your first request, and understand the response.

## Basic Usage

Set up a simple crawl using `BrowserConfig` and `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig()  # Default browser configuration
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()   # Default crawl run configuration

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )
        print(result.markdown)  # Print clean markdown content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

## Understanding the Response

The `arun()` method returns a `CrawlResult` object with several useful properties. Here's a quick overview (see [CrawlResult](../../api/crawl-result/) for complete details):

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
        content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.6),
        options={"ignore_links": True}
    )
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=config
)

# Different content formats
print(result.html)         # Raw HTML
print(result.cleaned_html) # Cleaned HTML
print(result.markdown.raw_markdown) # Raw markdown from cleaned html
print(result.markdown.fit_markdown) # Most relevant content in markdown

# Check success status
print(result.success)      # True if crawl succeeded
print(result.status_code)  # HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404)

# Access extracted media and links
print(result.media)        # Dictionary of found media (images, videos, audio)
print(result.links)        # Dictionary of internal and external links
Copy
```

## Adding Basic Options

Customize your crawl using `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    word_count_threshold=10,        # Minimum words per content block
    exclude_external_links=True,    # Remove external links
    remove_overlay_elements=True,   # Remove popups/modals
    process_iframes=True           # Process iframe content
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=run_config
)
Copy
```

## Handling Errors

Always check if the crawl was successful:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)

if not result.success:
    print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
    print(f"Status code: {result.status_code}")
Copy
```

## Logging and Debugging

Enable verbose logging in `BrowserConfig`:

```
browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)

async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
    result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)
Copy
```

## Complete Example

Here's a more comprehensive example demonstrating common usage patterns:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Content filtering
        word_count_threshold=10,
        excluded_tags=['form', 'header'],
        exclude_external_links=True,

        # Content processing
        process_iframes=True,
        remove_overlay_elements=True,

        # Cache control
        cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED  # Use cache if available
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )

        if result.success:
            # Print clean content
            print("Content:", result.markdown[:500])  # First 500 chars

            # Process images
            for image in result.media["images"]:
                print(f"Found image: {image['src']}")

            # Process links
            for link in result.links["internal"]:
                print(f"Internal link: {link['href']}")

        else:
            print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

# Deep Crawling

One of Crawl4AI's most powerful features is its ability to perform **configurable deep crawling** that can explore websites beyond a single page. With fine-tuned control over crawl depth, domain boundaries, and content filtering, Crawl4AI gives you the tools to extract precisely the content you need.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

1. How to set up a **Basic Deep Crawler** with BFS strategy
2. Understanding the difference between **streamed and non-streamed** output
3. Implementing **filters and scorers** to target specific content
4. Creating **advanced filtering chains** for sophisticated crawls
5. Using **BestFirstCrawling** for intelligent exploration prioritization

> **Prerequisites**  
> - You’ve completed or read [AsyncWebCrawler Basics](../simple-crawling/) to understand how to run a simple crawl.  
> - You know how to configure `CrawlerRunConfig`.

---

## 1. Quick Example

Here's a minimal code snippet that implements a basic deep crawl using the **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy

async def main():
    # Configure a 2-level deep crawl
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
            max_depth=2, 
            include_external=False
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        verbose=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

        print(f"Crawled {len(results)} pages in total")

        # Access individual results
        for result in results[:3]:  # Show first 3 results
            print(f"URL: {result.url}")
            print(f"Depth: {result.metadata.get('depth', 0)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**What's happening?**  
- `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=2, include_external=False)` instructs Crawl4AI to:
- Crawl the starting page (depth 0) plus 2 more levels
- Stay within the same domain (don't follow external links)
- Each result contains metadata like the crawl depth
- Results are returned as a list after all crawling is complete

---

## 2. Understanding Deep Crawling Strategy Options

### 2.1 BFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Breadth-First Search)

The **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a breadth-first approach, exploring all links at one depth before moving deeper:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=50,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.3,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.2 DFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Depth-First Search)

The **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a depth-first approach, explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import DFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=30,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.5,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.3 BestFirstCrawlingStrategy (⭐️ - Recommended Deep crawl strategy)

For more intelligent crawling, use **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy** with scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

# Create a scorer
scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7
)

# Configure the strategy
strategy = BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    include_external=False,
    url_scorer=scorer,
    max_pages=25,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
)
Copy
```

This crawling approach:
- Evaluates each discovered URL based on scorer criteria
- Visits higher-scoring pages first
- Helps focus crawl resources on the most relevant content
- Can limit total pages crawled with `max_pages`
- Does not need `score_threshold` as it naturally prioritizes by score

---

## 3. Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Results

Crawl4AI can return results in two modes:

### 3.1 Non-Streaming Mode (Default)

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=False  # Default behavior
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Wait for ALL results to be collected before returning
    results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

    for result in results:
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**When to use non-streaming mode:**
- You need the complete dataset before processing
- You're performing batch operations on all results together
- Crawl time isn't a critical factor

### 3.2 Streaming Mode

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=True  # Enable streaming
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Returns an async iterator
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        # Process each result as it becomes available
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**Benefits of streaming mode:**
- Process results immediately as they're discovered
- Start working with early results while crawling continues
- Better for real-time applications or progressive display
- Reduces memory pressure when handling many pages

---

## 4. Filtering Content with Filter Chains

Filters help you narrow down which pages to crawl. Combine multiple filters using **FilterChain** for powerful targeting.

### 4.1 Basic URL Pattern Filter

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, URLPatternFilter

# Only follow URLs containing "blog" or "docs"
url_filter = URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*blog*", "*docs*"])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([url_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.2 Combining Multiple Filters

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    URLPatternFilter,
    DomainFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)

# Create a chain of filters
filter_chain = FilterChain([
    # Only follow URLs with specific patterns
    URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*"]),

    # Only crawl specific domains
    DomainFilter(
        allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
        blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
    ),

    # Only include specific content types
    ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        filter_chain=filter_chain
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.3 Available Filter Types

Crawl4AI includes several specialized filters:

* **`URLPatternFilter`**: Matches URL patterns using wildcard syntax
* **`DomainFilter`**: Controls which domains to include or exclude
* **`ContentTypeFilter`**: Filters based on HTTP Content-Type
* **`ContentRelevanceFilter`**: Uses similarity to a text query
* **`SEOFilter`**: Evaluates SEO elements (meta tags, headers, etc.)

---

## 5. Using Scorers for Prioritized Crawling

Scorers assign priority values to discovered URLs, helping the crawler focus on the most relevant content first.

### 5.1 KeywordRelevanceScorer

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy

# Create a keyword relevance scorer
keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7  # Importance of this scorer (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        url_scorer=keyword_scorer
    ),
    stream=True  # Recommended with BestFirstCrawling
)

# Results will come in order of relevance score
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
        print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")
Copy
```

**How scorers work:**
- Evaluate each discovered URL before crawling
- Calculate relevance based on various signals
- Help the crawler make intelligent choices about traversal order

---

## 6. Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 6.1 SEO Filter for Quality Assessment

The **SEOFilter** helps you identify pages with strong SEO characteristics:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, SEOFilter

# Create an SEO filter that looks for specific keywords in page metadata
seo_filter = SEOFilter(
    threshold=0.5,  # Minimum score (0.0 to 1.0)
    keywords=["tutorial", "guide", "documentation"]
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([seo_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 6.2 Content Relevance Filter

The **ContentRelevanceFilter** analyzes the actual content of pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, ContentRelevanceFilter

# Create a content relevance filter
relevance_filter = ContentRelevanceFilter(
    query="Web crawling and data extraction with Python",
    threshold=0.7  # Minimum similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([relevance_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

This filter:
- Measures semantic similarity between query and page content

## 7. Building a Complete Advanced Crawler

This example combines multiple techniques for a sophisticated crawl:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    DomainFilter,
    URLPatternFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

async def run_advanced_crawler():
    # Create a sophisticated filter chain
    filter_chain = FilterChain([
        # Domain boundaries
        DomainFilter(
            allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
            blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
        ),

        # URL patterns to include
        URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*", "*blog*"]),

        # Content type filtering
        ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
    ])

    # Create a relevance scorer
    keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
        keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
        weight=0.7
    )

    # Set up the configuration
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
            max_depth=2,
            include_external=False,
            filter_chain=filter_chain,
            url_scorer=keyword_scorer
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        stream=True,
        verbose=True
    )

    # Execute the crawl
    results = []
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
            results.append(result)
            score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
            depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
            print(f"Depth: {depth} | Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")

    # Analyze the results
    print(f"Crawled {len(results)} high-value pages")
    print(f"Average score: {sum(r.metadata.get('score', 0) for r in results) / len(results):.2f}")

    # Group by depth
    depth_counts = {}
    for result in results:
        depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
        depth_counts[depth] = depth_counts.get(depth, 0) + 1

    print("Pages crawled by depth:")
    for depth, count in sorted(depth_counts.items()):
        print(f"  Depth {depth}: {count} pages")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_advanced_crawler())
Copy
```

---

## 8. Limiting and Controlling Crawl Size

### 8.1 Using max\_pages

You can limit the total number of pages crawled with the `max_pages` parameter:

```
# Limit to exactly 20 pages regardless of depth
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=3,
    max_pages=20
)
Copy
```

This feature is useful for:
- Controlling API costs
- Setting predictable execution times
- Focusing on the most important content
- Testing crawl configurations before full execution

### 8.2 Using score\_threshold

For BFS and DFS strategies, you can set a minimum score threshold to only crawl high-quality pages:

```
# Only follow links with scores above 0.4
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    url_scorer=KeywordRelevanceScorer(keywords=["api", "guide", "reference"]),
    score_threshold=0.4  # Skip URLs with scores below this value
)
Copy
```

Note that for BestFirstCrawlingStrategy, score\_threshold is not needed since pages are already processed in order of highest score first.

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Tips

1.**Set realistic limits.** Be cautious with `max_depth` values > 3, which can exponentially increase crawl size. Use `max_pages` to set hard limits.

2.**Don't neglect the scoring component.** BestFirstCrawling works best with well-tuned scorers. Experiment with keyword weights for optimal prioritization.

3.**Be a good web citizen.** Respect robots.txt. (disabled by default)

4.**Handle page errors gracefully.** Not all pages will be accessible. Check `result.status` when processing results.

5.**Balance breadth vs. depth.** Choose your strategy wisely - BFS for comprehensive coverage, DFS for deep exploration, BestFirst for focused relevance-based crawling.

---

## 10. Summary & Next Steps

In this **Deep Crawling with Crawl4AI** tutorial, you learned to:

* Configure **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, and **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy**
* Process results in streaming or non-streaming mode
* Apply filters to target specific content
* Use scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages
* Limit crawls with `max_pages` and `score_threshold` parameters
* Build a complete advanced crawler with combined techniques

With these tools, you can efficiently extract structured data from websites at scale, focusing precisely on the content you need for your specific use case.

# Adaptive Web Crawling

## Introduction

Traditional web crawlers follow predetermined patterns, crawling pages blindly without knowing when they've gathered enough information. **Adaptive Crawling** changes this paradigm by introducing intelligence into the crawling process.

Think of it like research: when you're looking for information, you don't read every book in the library. You stop when you've found sufficient information to answer your question. That's exactly what Adaptive Crawling does for web scraping.

## Key Concepts

### The Problem It Solves

When crawling websites for specific information, you face two challenges:
1. **Under-crawling**: Stopping too early and missing crucial information
2. **Over-crawling**: Wasting resources by crawling irrelevant pages

Adaptive Crawling solves both by using a three-layer scoring system that determines when you have "enough" information.

### How It Works

The AdaptiveCrawler uses three metrics to measure information sufficiency:

* **Coverage**: How well your collected pages cover the query terms
* **Consistency**: Whether the information is coherent across pages
* **Saturation**: Detecting when new pages aren't adding new information

When these metrics indicate sufficient information has been gathered, crawling stops automatically.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, AdaptiveCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Create an adaptive crawler (config is optional)
        adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)

        # Start crawling with a query
        result = await adaptive.digest(
            start_url="
            query="async context managers"
        )

        # View statistics
        adaptive.print_stats()

        # Get the most relevant content
        relevant_pages = adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=5)
        for page in relevant_pages:
            print(f"- {page['url']} (score: {page['score']:.2f})")
Copy
```

### Configuration Options

```
from crawl4ai import AdaptiveConfig

config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.8,    # Stop when 80% confident (default: 0.7)
    max_pages=30,               # Maximum pages to crawl (default: 20)
    top_k_links=5,              # Links to follow per page (default: 3)
    min_gain_threshold=0.05     # Minimum expected gain to continue (default: 0.1)
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
Copy
```

## Crawling Strategies

Adaptive Crawling supports two distinct strategies for determining information sufficiency:

### Statistical Strategy (Default)

The statistical strategy uses pure information theory and term-based analysis:

* **Fast and efficient** - No API calls or model loading
* **Term-based coverage** - Analyzes query term presence and distribution
* **No external dependencies** - Works offline
* **Best for**: Well-defined queries with specific terminology

```
# Default configuration uses statistical strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="statistical",  # This is the default
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)
Copy
```

### Embedding Strategy

The embedding strategy uses semantic embeddings for deeper understanding:

* **Semantic understanding** - Captures meaning beyond exact term matches
* **Query expansion** - Automatically generates query variations
* **Gap-driven selection** - Identifies semantic gaps in knowledge
* **Validation-based stopping** - Uses held-out queries to validate coverage
* **Best for**: Complex queries, ambiguous topics, conceptual understanding

```
# Configure embedding strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",  # Default
    n_query_variations=10,  # Generate 10 query variations
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1  # Stop if completely irrelevant
)

# With custom embedding provider (e.g., OpenAI)
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_llm_config={
        'provider': 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
        'api_token': 'your-api-key'
    }
)
Copy
```

### Strategy Comparison

| Feature | Statistical | Embedding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Moderate (API calls) |
| **Cost** | Free | Depends on provider |
| **Accuracy** | Good for exact terms | Excellent for concepts |
| **Dependencies** | None | Embedding model/API |
| **Query Understanding** | Literal | Semantic |
| **Best Use Case** | Technical docs, specific terms | Research, broad topics |

### Embedding Strategy Configuration

The embedding strategy offers fine-tuned control through several parameters:

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",

    # Model configuration
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    embedding_llm_config=None,  # Use for API-based embeddings

    # Query expansion
    n_query_variations=10,  # Number of query variations to generate

    # Coverage parameters
    embedding_coverage_radius=0.2,  # Distance threshold for coverage
    embedding_k_exp=3.0,  # Exponential decay factor (higher = stricter)

    # Stopping criteria
    embedding_min_relative_improvement=0.1,  # Min improvement to continue
    embedding_validation_min_score=0.3,  # Min validation score
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1,  # Below this = irrelevant

    # Link selection
    embedding_overlap_threshold=0.85,  # Similarity for deduplication

    # Display confidence mapping
    embedding_quality_min_confidence=0.7,  # Min displayed confidence
    embedding_quality_max_confidence=0.95  # Max displayed confidence
)
Copy
```

### Handling Irrelevant Queries

The embedding strategy can detect when a query is completely unrelated to the content:

```
# This will stop quickly with low confidence
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="how to cook pasta"  # Irrelevant to Python docs
)

# Check if query was irrelevant
if result.metrics.get('is_irrelevant', False):
    print("Query is unrelated to the content!")
Copy
```

## When to Use Adaptive Crawling

### Perfect For:

* **Research Tasks**: Finding comprehensive information about a topic
* **Question Answering**: Gathering sufficient context to answer specific queries
* **Knowledge Base Building**: Creating focused datasets for AI/ML applications
* **Competitive Intelligence**: Collecting complete information about specific products/features

### Not Recommended For:

* **Full Site Archiving**: When you need every page regardless of content
* **Structured Data Extraction**: When targeting specific, known page patterns
* **Real-time Monitoring**: When you need continuous updates

## Understanding the Output

### Confidence Score

The confidence score (0-1) indicates how sufficient the gathered information is:
- **0.0-0.3**: Insufficient information, needs more crawling
- **0.3-0.6**: Partial information, may answer basic queries
- **0.6-0.7**: Good coverage, can answer most queries
- **0.7-1.0**: Excellent coverage, comprehensive information

### Statistics Display

```
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=False)  # Summary table
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=True)   # Detailed metrics
Copy
```

The summary shows:
- Pages crawled vs. confidence achieved
- Coverage, consistency, and saturation scores
- Crawling efficiency metrics

## Persistence and Resumption

### Saving Progress

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    save_state=True,
    state_path="my_crawl_state.json"
)

# Crawl will auto-save progress
result = await adaptive.digest(start_url, query)
Copy
```

### Resuming a Crawl

```
# Resume from saved state
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url,
    query,
    resume_from="my_crawl_state.json"
)
Copy
```

### Exporting Knowledge Base

```
# Export collected pages to JSONL
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")

# Import into another session
new_adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)
new_adaptive.import_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")
Copy
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Query Formulation

* Use specific, descriptive queries
* Include key terms you expect to find
* Avoid overly broad queries

### 2. Threshold Tuning

* Start with default (0.7) for general use
* Lower to 0.5-0.6 for exploratory crawling
* Raise to 0.8+ for exhaustive coverage

### 3. Performance Optimization

* Use appropriate `max_pages` limits
* Adjust `top_k_links` based on site structure
* Enable caching for repeat crawls

### 4. Link Selection

* The crawler prioritizes links based on:
* Relevance to query
* Expected information gain
* URL structure and depth

## Examples

### Research Assistant

```
# Gather information about a programming concept
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="python decorators implementation patterns"
)

# Get the most relevant excerpts
for doc in adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=3):
    print(f"\nFrom: {doc['url']}")
    print(f"Relevance: {doc['score']:.2%}")
    print(doc['content'][:500] + "...")
Copy
```

### Knowledge Base Builder

```
# Build a focused knowledge base about machine learning
queries = [
    "supervised learning algorithms",
    "neural network architectures", 
    "model evaluation metrics"
]

for query in queries:
    await adaptive.digest(
        start_url="
        query=query
    )

# Export combined knowledge base
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("ml_knowledge.jsonl")
Copy
```

### API Documentation Crawler

```
# Intelligently crawl API documentation
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.85,  # Higher threshold for completeness
    max_pages=30
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="authentication endpoints rate limits"
)
Copy
```

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from traditional crawling?**
A: Traditional crawling follows fixed patterns (BFS/DFS). Adaptive crawling makes intelligent decisions about which links to follow and when to stop based on information gain.

**Q: Can I use this with JavaScript-heavy sites?**
A: Yes! AdaptiveCrawler inherits all capabilities from AsyncWebCrawler, including JavaScript execution.

**Q: How does it handle large websites?**
A: The algorithm naturally limits crawling to relevant sections. Use `max_pages` as a safety limit.

**Q: Can I customize the scoring algorithms?**
A: Advanced users can implement custom strategies. See [Adaptive Strategies](../../advanced/adaptive-strategies/).

When crawling websites for specific information, you face two challenges:
1. **Under-crawling**: Stopping too early and missing crucial information
2. **Over-crawling**: Wasting resources by crawling irrelevant pages

Adaptive Crawling solves both by using a three-layer scoring system that determines when you have "enough" information.

### How It Works

The AdaptiveCrawler uses three metrics to measure information sufficiency:

* **Coverage**: How well your collected pages cover the query terms
* **Consistency**: Whether the information is coherent across pages
* **Saturation**: Detecting when new pages aren't adding new information

When these metrics indicate sufficient information has been gathered, crawling stops automatically.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, AdaptiveCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Create an adaptive crawler (config is optional)
        adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)

        # Start crawling with a query
        result = await adaptive.digest(
            start_url="
            query="async context managers"
        )

        # View statistics
        adaptive.print_stats()

        # Get the most relevant content
        relevant_pages = adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=5)
        for page in relevant_pages:
            print(f"- {page['url']} (score: {page['score']:.2f})")
Copy
```

### Configuration Options

```
from crawl4ai import AdaptiveConfig

config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.8,    # Stop when 80% confident (default: 0.7)
    max_pages=30,               # Maximum pages to crawl (default: 20)
    top_k_links=5,              # Links to follow per page (default: 3)
    min_gain_threshold=0.05     # Minimum expected gain to continue (default: 0.1)
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
Copy
```

## Crawling Strategies

Adaptive Crawling supports two distinct strategies for determining information sufficiency:

### Statistical Strategy (Default)

The statistical strategy uses pure information theory and term-based analysis:

* **Fast and efficient** - No API calls or model loading
* **Term-based coverage** - Analyzes query term presence and distribution
* **No external dependencies** - Works offline
* **Best for**: Well-defined queries with specific terminology

```
# Default configuration uses statistical strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="statistical",  # This is the default
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)
Copy
```

### Embedding Strategy

The embedding strategy uses semantic embeddings for deeper understanding:

* **Semantic understanding** - Captures meaning beyond exact term matches
* **Query expansion** - Automatically generates query variations
* **Gap-driven selection** - Identifies semantic gaps in knowledge
* **Validation-based stopping** - Uses held-out queries to validate coverage
* **Best for**: Complex queries, ambiguous topics, conceptual understanding

```
# Configure embedding strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",  # Default
    n_query_variations=10,  # Generate 10 query variations
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1  # Stop if completely irrelevant
)

# With custom embedding provider (e.g., OpenAI)
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_llm_config={
        'provider': 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
        'api_token': 'your-api-key'
    }
)
Copy
```

### Strategy Comparison

| Feature | Statistical | Embedding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Moderate (API calls) |
| **Cost** | Free | Depends on provider |
| **Accuracy** | Good for exact terms | Excellent for concepts |
| **Dependencies** | None | Embedding model/API |
| **Query Understanding** | Literal | Semantic |
| **Best Use Case** | Technical docs, specific terms | Research, broad topics |

### Embedding Strategy Configuration

The embedding strategy offers fine-tuned control through several parameters:

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",

    # Model configuration
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    embedding_llm_config=None,  # Use for API-based embeddings

    # Query expansion
    n_query_variations=10,  # Number of query variations to generate

    # Coverage parameters
    embedding_coverage_radius=0.2,  # Distance threshold for coverage
    embedding_k_exp=3.0,  # Exponential decay factor (higher = stricter)

    # Stopping criteria
    embedding_min_relative_improvement=0.1,  # Min improvement to continue
    embedding_validation_min_score=0.3,  # Min validation score
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1,  # Below this = irrelevant

    # Link selection
    embedding_overlap_threshold=0.85,  # Similarity for deduplication

    # Display confidence mapping
    embedding_quality_min_confidence=0.7,  # Min displayed confidence
    embedding_quality_max_confidence=0.95  # Max displayed confidence
)
Copy
```

### Handling Irrelevant Queries

The embedding strategy can detect when a query is completely unrelated to the content:

```
# This will stop quickly with low confidence
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="how to cook pasta"  # Irrelevant to Python docs
)

# Check if query was irrelevant
if result.metrics.get('is_irrelevant', False):
    print("Query is unrelated to the content!")
Copy
```

## When to Use Adaptive Crawling

### Perfect For:

* **Research Tasks**: Finding comprehensive information about a topic
* **Question Answering**: Gathering sufficient context to answer specific queries
* **Knowledge Base Building**: Creating focused datasets for AI/ML applications
* **Competitive Intelligence**: Collecting complete information about specific products/features

### Not Recommended For:

* **Full Site Archiving**: When you need every page regardless of content
* **Structured Data Extraction**: When targeting specific, known page patterns
* **Real-time Monitoring**: When you need continuous updates

## Understanding the Output

### Confidence Score

The confidence score (0-1) indicates how sufficient the gathered information is:
- **0.0-0.3**: Insufficient information, needs more crawling
- **0.3-0.6**: Partial information, may answer basic queries
- **0.6-0.7**: Good coverage, can answer most queries
- **0.7-1.0**: Excellent coverage, comprehensive information

### Statistics Display

```
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=False)  # Summary table
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=True)   # Detailed metrics
Copy
```

The summary shows:
- Pages crawled vs. confidence achieved
- Coverage, consistency, and saturation scores
- Crawling efficiency metrics

## Persistence and Resumption

### Saving Progress

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    save_state=True,
    state_path="my_crawl_state.json"
)

# Crawl will auto-save progress
result = await adaptive.digest(start_url, query)
Copy
```

### Resuming a Crawl

```
# Resume from saved state
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url,
    query,
    resume_from="my_crawl_state.json"
)
Copy
```

### Exporting Knowledge Base

```
# Export collected pages to JSONL
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")

# Import into another session
new_adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)
new_adaptive.import_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")
Copy
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Query Formulation

* Use specific, descriptive queries
* Include key terms you expect to find
* Avoid overly broad queries

### 2. Threshold Tuning

* Start with default (0.7) for general use
* Lower to 0.5-0.6 for exploratory crawling
* Raise to 0.8+ for exhaustive coverage

### 3. Performance Optimization

* Use appropriate `max_pages` limits
* Adjust `top_k_links` based on site structure
* Enable caching for repeat crawls

### 4. Link Selection

* The crawler prioritizes links based on:
* Relevance to query
* Expected information gain
* URL structure and depth

## Examples

### Research Assistant

```
# Gather information about a programming concept
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="python decorators implementation patterns"
)

# Get the most relevant excerpts
for doc in adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=3):
    print(f"\nFrom: {doc['url']}")
    print(f"Relevance: {doc['score']:.2%}")
    print(doc['content'][:500] + "...")
Copy
```

### Knowledge Base Builder

```
# Build a focused knowledge base about machine learning
queries = [
    "supervised learning algorithms",
    "neural network architectures", 
    "model evaluation metrics"
]

for query in queries:
    await adaptive.digest(
        start_url="
        query=query
    )

# Export combined knowledge base
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("ml_knowledge.jsonl")
Copy
```

### API Documentation Crawler

```
# Intelligently crawl API documentation
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.85,  # Higher threshold for completeness
    max_pages=30
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="authentication endpoints rate limits"
)
Copy
```

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from traditional crawling?**
A: Traditional crawling follows fixed patterns (BFS/DFS). Adaptive crawling makes intelligent decisions about which links to follow and when to stop based on information gain.

**Q: Can I use this with JavaScript-heavy sites?**
A: Yes! AdaptiveCrawler inherits all capabilities from AsyncWebCrawler, including JavaScript execution.

**Q: How does it handle large websites?**
A: The algorithm naturally limits crawling to relevant sections. Use `max_pages` as a safety limit.

**Q: Can I customize the scoring algorithms?**
A: Advanced users can implement custom strategies. See [Adaptive Strategies](../../advanced/adaptive-strategies/).

You are an expert assistant. Using only the current webpage content below, answer the user's question by quoting the relevant passage, code block, or table WORD-FOR-WORD, including ALL formatting, indentation, and line breaks. DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or shorten ANY part of the quoted answer, unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize giving the most detailed answer possible by quoting the all relevant text from the content. If the content has numbers, prices, code, tables, or other specific details, quote them exactly as they appear. If multiple relevant passages are found, include ALL of them in their entirety, word-for-word. ALWAYS provide which page they should visit to find the exact information they are looking for, if possible, by saying 'Please visit [page URL] for the full details.' If you cite information from a source, always include the full URL shown in the source.If no answer is found, summarize anything related, and politely inform the user that the answer does not appear to be present, suggest a related page by URL if present in the content. Do not hallucinate.At the end, write 'SUFFICIENT: YES' if the answer fully resolves the question, or 'SUFFICIENT: NO' if not.

# Deep Crawling

One of Crawl4AI's most powerful features is its ability to perform **configurable deep crawling** that can explore websites beyond a single page. With fine-tuned control over crawl depth, domain boundaries, and content filtering, Crawl4AI gives you the tools to extract precisely the content you need.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

1. How to set up a **Basic Deep Crawler** with BFS strategy
2. Understanding the difference between **streamed and non-streamed** output
3. Implementing **filters and scorers** to target specific content
4. Creating **advanced filtering chains** for sophisticated crawls
5. Using **BestFirstCrawling** for intelligent exploration prioritization

> **Prerequisites**  
> - You’ve completed or read [AsyncWebCrawler Basics](../simple-crawling/) to understand how to run a simple crawl.  
> - You know how to configure `CrawlerRunConfig`.

---

## 1. Quick Example

Here's a minimal code snippet that implements a basic deep crawl using the **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy

async def main():
    # Configure a 2-level deep crawl
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
            max_depth=2, 
            include_external=False
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        verbose=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

        print(f"Crawled {len(results)} pages in total")

        # Access individual results
        for result in results[:3]:  # Show first 3 results
            print(f"URL: {result.url}")
            print(f"Depth: {result.metadata.get('depth', 0)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**What's happening?**  
- `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=2, include_external=False)` instructs Crawl4AI to:
- Crawl the starting page (depth 0) plus 2 more levels
- Stay within the same domain (don't follow external links)
- Each result contains metadata like the crawl depth
- Results are returned as a list after all crawling is complete

---

## 2. Understanding Deep Crawling Strategy Options

### 2.1 BFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Breadth-First Search)

The **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a breadth-first approach, exploring all links at one depth before moving deeper:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=50,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.3,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.2 DFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Depth-First Search)

The **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a depth-first approach, explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import DFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=30,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.5,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.3 BestFirstCrawlingStrategy (⭐️ - Recommended Deep crawl strategy)

For more intelligent crawling, use **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy** with scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

# Create a scorer
scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7
)

# Configure the strategy
strategy = BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    include_external=False,
    url_scorer=scorer,
    max_pages=25,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
)
Copy
```

This crawling approach:
- Evaluates each discovered URL based on scorer criteria
- Visits higher-scoring pages first
- Helps focus crawl resources on the most relevant content
- Can limit total pages crawled with `max_pages`
- Does not need `score_threshold` as it naturally prioritizes by score

---

## 3. Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Results

Crawl4AI can return results in two modes:

### 3.1 Non-Streaming Mode (Default)

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=False  # Default behavior
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Wait for ALL results to be collected before returning
    results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

    for result in results:
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**When to use non-streaming mode:**
- You need the complete dataset before processing
- You're performing batch operations on all results together
- Crawl time isn't a critical factor

### 3.2 Streaming Mode

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=True  # Enable streaming
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Returns an async iterator
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        # Process each result as it becomes available
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**Benefits of streaming mode:**
- Process results immediately as they're discovered
- Start working with early results while crawling continues
- Better for real-time applications or progressive display
- Reduces memory pressure when handling many pages

---

## 4. Filtering Content with Filter Chains

Filters help you narrow down which pages to crawl. Combine multiple filters using **FilterChain** for powerful targeting.

### 4.1 Basic URL Pattern Filter

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, URLPatternFilter

# Only follow URLs containing "blog" or "docs"
url_filter = URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*blog*", "*docs*"])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([url_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.2 Combining Multiple Filters

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    URLPatternFilter,
    DomainFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)

# Create a chain of filters
filter_chain = FilterChain([
    # Only follow URLs with specific patterns
    URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*"]),

    # Only crawl specific domains
    DomainFilter(
        allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
        blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
    ),

    # Only include specific content types
    ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        filter_chain=filter_chain
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.3 Available Filter Types

Crawl4AI includes several specialized filters:

* **`URLPatternFilter`**: Matches URL patterns using wildcard syntax
* **`DomainFilter`**: Controls which domains to include or exclude
* **`ContentTypeFilter`**: Filters based on HTTP Content-Type
* **`ContentRelevanceFilter`**: Uses similarity to a text query
* **`SEOFilter`**: Evaluates SEO elements (meta tags, headers, etc.)

---

## 5. Using Scorers for Prioritized Crawling

Scorers assign priority values to discovered URLs, helping the crawler focus on the most relevant content first.

### 5.1 KeywordRelevanceScorer

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy

# Create a keyword relevance scorer
keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7  # Importance of this scorer (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        url_scorer=keyword_scorer
    ),
    stream=True  # Recommended with BestFirstCrawling
)

# Results will come in order of relevance score
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
        print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")
Copy
```

**How scorers work:**
- Evaluate each discovered URL before crawling
- Calculate relevance based on various signals
- Help the crawler make intelligent choices about traversal order

---

## 6. Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 6.1 SEO Filter for Quality Assessment

The **SEOFilter** helps you identify pages with strong SEO characteristics:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, SEOFilter

# Create an SEO filter that looks for specific keywords in page metadata
seo_filter = SEOFilter(
    threshold=0.5,  # Minimum score (0.0 to 1.0)
    keywords=["tutorial", "guide", "documentation"]
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([seo_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 6.2 Content Relevance Filter

The **ContentRelevanceFilter** analyzes the actual content of pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, ContentRelevanceFilter

# Create a content relevance filter
relevance_filter = ContentRelevanceFilter(
    query="Web crawling and data extraction with Python",
    threshold=0.7  # Minimum similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([relevance_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

This filter:
- Measures semantic similarity between query and page content
- It's a BM25-based relevance filter using head section content

---

## 7. Building a Complete Advanced Crawler

This example combines multiple techniques for a sophisticated crawl:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    DomainFilter,
    URLPatternFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

async def run_advanced_crawler():
    # Create a sophisticated filter chain
    filter_chain = FilterChain([
        # Domain boundaries
        DomainFilter(
            allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
            blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
        ),

        # URL patterns to include
        URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*", "*blog*"]),

        # Content type filtering
        ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
    ])

    # Create a relevance scorer
    keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
        keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
        weight=0.7
    )

    # Set up the configuration
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
            max_depth=2,
            include_external=False,
            filter_chain=filter_chain,
            url_scorer=keyword_scorer
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        stream=True,
        verbose=True
    )

    # Execute the crawl
    results = []
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:

## 8. Limiting and Controlling Crawl Size

### 8.1 Using max\_pages

You can limit the total number of pages crawled with the `max_pages` parameter:

```
# Limit to exactly 20 pages regardless of depth
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=3,
    max_pages=20
)
Copy
```

This feature is useful for:
- Controlling API costs
- Setting predictable execution times
- Focusing on the most important content
- Testing crawl configurations before full execution

### 8.2 Using score\_threshold

For BFS and DFS strategies, you can set a minimum score threshold to only crawl high-quality pages:

```
# Only follow links with scores above 0.4
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    url_scorer=KeywordRelevanceScorer(keywords=["api", "guide", "reference"]),
    score_threshold=0.4  # Skip URLs with scores below this value
)
Copy
```

Note that for BestFirstCrawlingStrategy, score\_threshold is not needed since pages are already processed in order of highest score first.

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Tips

1.**Set realistic limits.** Be cautious with `max_depth` values > 3, which can exponentially increase crawl size. Use `max_pages` to set hard limits.

2.**Don't neglect the scoring component.** BestFirstCrawling works best with well-tuned scorers. Experiment with keyword weights for optimal prioritization.

3.**Be a good web citizen.** Respect robots.txt. (disabled by default)

4.**Handle page errors gracefully.** Not all pages will be accessible. Check `result.status` when processing results.

5.**Balance breadth vs. depth.** Choose your strategy wisely - BFS for comprehensive coverage, DFS for deep exploration, BestFirst for focused relevance-based crawling.

---

## 10. Summary & Next Steps

In this **Deep Crawling with Crawl4AI** tutorial, you learned to:

* Configure **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, and **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy**
* Process results in streaming or non-streaming mode
* Apply filters to target specific content
* Use scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages
* Limit crawls with `max_pages` and `score_threshold` parameters
* Build a complete advanced crawler with combined techniques

With these tools, you can efficiently extract structured data from websites at scale, focusing precisely on the content you need for your specific use case.

# Simple Crawling

This guide covers the basics of web crawling with Crawl4AI. You'll learn how to set up a crawler, make your first request, and understand the response.

## Basic Usage

Set up a simple crawl using `BrowserConfig` and `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig()  # Default browser configuration
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()   # Default crawl run configuration

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )
        print(result.markdown)  # Print clean markdown content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

## Understanding the Response

The `arun()` method returns a `CrawlResult` object with several useful properties. Here's a quick overview (see [CrawlResult](../../api/crawl-result/) for complete details):

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
        content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.6),
        options={"ignore_links": True}
    )
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=config
)

# Different content formats
print(result.html)         # Raw HTML
print(result.cleaned_html) # Cleaned HTML
print(result.markdown.raw_markdown) # Raw markdown from cleaned html
print(result.markdown.fit_markdown) # Most relevant content in markdown

# Check success status
print(result.success)      # True if crawl succeeded
print(result.status_code)  # HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404)

# Access extracted media and links
print(result.media)        # Dictionary of found media (images, videos, audio)
print(result.links)        # Dictionary of internal and external links
Copy
```

## Adding Basic Options

Customize your crawl using `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    word_count_threshold=10,        # Minimum words per content block
    exclude_external_links=True,    # Remove external links
    remove_overlay_elements=True,   # Remove popups/modals
    process_iframes=True           # Process iframe content
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=run_config
)
Copy
```

## Handling Errors

Always check if the crawl was successful:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)

if not result.success:
    print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
    print(f"Status code: {result.status_code}")
Copy
```

## Logging and Debugging

Enable verbose logging in `BrowserConfig`:

```
browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)

async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
    result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)
Copy
```

## Complete Example

Here's a more comprehensive example demonstrating common usage patterns:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Content filtering
        word_count_threshold=10,
        excluded_tags=['form', 'header'],
        exclude_external_links=True,

        # Content processing
        process_iframes=True,
        remove_overlay_elements=True,

        # Cache control
        cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED  # Use cache if available
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )

        if result.success:
            # Print clean content
            print("Content:", result.markdown[:500])  # First 500 chars

            # Process images
            for image in result.media["images"]:
                print(f"Found image: {image['src']}")

            # Process links
            for link in result.links["internal"]:
                print(f"Internal link: {link['href']}")

        else:
            print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

# Adaptive Web Crawling

## Introduction

Traditional web crawlers follow predetermined patterns, crawling pages blindly without knowing when they've gathered enough information. **Adaptive Crawling** changes this paradigm by introducing intelligence into the crawling process.

Think of it like research: when you're looking for information, you don't read every book in the library. You stop when you've found sufficient information to answer your question. That's exactly what Adaptive Crawling does for web scraping.

## Key Concepts

### The Problem It Solves

When crawling websites for specific information, you face two challenges:
1. **Under-crawling**: Stopping too early and missing crucial information
2. **Over-crawling**: Wasting resources by crawling irrelevant pages

Adaptive Crawling solves both by using a three-layer scoring system that determines when you have "enough" information.

### How It Works

The AdaptiveCrawler uses three metrics to measure information sufficiency:

* **Coverage**: How well your collected pages cover the query terms
* **Consistency**: Whether the information is coherent across pages
* **Saturation**: Detecting when new pages aren't adding new information

When these metrics indicate sufficient information has been gathered, crawling stops automatically.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, AdaptiveCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Create an adaptive crawler (config is optional)
        adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)

        # Start crawling with a query
        result = await adaptive.digest(
            start_url="
            query="async context managers"
        )

        # View statistics
        adaptive.print_stats()

        # Get the most relevant content
        relevant_pages = adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=5)
        for page in relevant_pages:
            print(f"- {page['url']} (score: {page['score']:.2f})")
Copy
```

### Configuration Options

```
from crawl4ai import AdaptiveConfig

config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.8,    # Stop when 80% confident (default: 0.7)
    max_pages=30,               # Maximum pages to crawl (default: 20)
    top_k_links=5,              # Links to follow per page (default: 3)
    min_gain_threshold=0.05     # Minimum expected gain to continue (default: 0.1)
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
Copy
```

## Crawling Strategies

Adaptive Crawling supports two distinct strategies for determining information sufficiency:

### Statistical Strategy (Default)

The statistical strategy uses pure information theory and term-based analysis:

* **Fast and efficient** - No API calls or model loading
* **Term-based coverage** - Analyzes query term presence and distribution
* **No external dependencies** - Works offline
* **Best for**: Well-defined queries with specific terminology

```
# Default configuration uses statistical strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="statistical",  # This is the default
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)
Copy
```

### Embedding Strategy

The embedding strategy uses semantic embeddings for deeper understanding:

* **Semantic understanding** - Captures meaning beyond exact term matches
* **Query expansion** - Automatically generates query variations
* **Gap-driven selection** - Identifies semantic gaps in knowledge
* **Validation-based stopping** - Uses held-out queries to validate coverage
* **Best for**: Complex queries, ambiguous topics, conceptual understanding

```
# Configure embedding strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",  # Default
    n_query_variations=10,  # Generate 10 query variations
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1  # Stop if completely irrelevant
)

# With custom embedding provider (e.g., OpenAI)
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_llm_config={
        'provider': 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
        'api_token': 'your-api-key'
    }
)
Copy
```

### Strategy Comparison

| Feature | Statistical | Embedding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Moderate (API calls) |
| **Cost** | Free | Depends on provider |
| **Accuracy** | Good for exact terms | Excellent for concepts |
| **Dependencies** | None | Embedding model/API |
| **Query Understanding** | Literal | Semantic |
| **Best Use Case** | Technical docs, specific terms | Research, broad topics |

### Embedding Strategy Configuration

The embedding strategy offers fine-tuned control through several parameters:

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",

    # Model configuration
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    embedding_llm_config=None,  # Use for API-based embeddings

    # Query expansion
    n_query_variations=10,  # Number of query variations to generate

    # Coverage parameters
    embedding_coverage_radius=0.2,  # Distance threshold for coverage
    embedding_k_exp=3.0,  # Exponential decay factor (higher = stricter)

    # Stopping criteria
    embedding_min_relative_improvement=0.1,  # Min improvement to continue
    embedding_validation_min_score=0.3,  # Min validation score
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1,  # Below this = irrelevant

    # Link selection
    embedding_overlap_threshold=0.85,  # Similarity for deduplication

    # Display confidence mapping
    embedding_quality_min_confidence=0.7,  # Min displayed confidence
    embedding_quality_max_confidence=0.95  # Max displayed confidence
)
Copy
```

### Handling Irrelevant Queries

The embedding strategy can detect when a query is completely unrelated to the content:

```
# This will stop quickly with low confidence
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="how to cook pasta"  # Irrelevant to Python docs
)

# Check if query was irrelevant
if result.metrics.get('is_irrelevant', False):
    print("Query is unrelated to the content!")
Copy
```

## When to Use Adaptive Crawling

### Perfect For:

* **Research Tasks**: Finding comprehensive information about a topic
* **Question Answering**: Gathering sufficient context to answer specific queries
* **Knowledge Base Building**: Creating focused datasets for AI/ML applications
* **Competitive Intelligence**: Collecting complete information about specific products/features

### Not Recommended For:

* **Full Site Archiving**: When you need every page regardless of content
* **Structured Data Extraction**: When targeting specific, known page patterns
* **Real-time Monitoring**: When you need continuous updates

## Understanding the Output

### Confidence Score

The confidence score (0-1) indicates how sufficient the gathered information is:
- **0.0-0.3**: Insufficient information, needs more crawling
- **0.3-0.6**: Partial information, may answer basic queries
- **0.6-0.7**: Good coverage, can answer most queries
- **0.7-1.0**: Excellent coverage, comprehensive information

### Statistics Display

```
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=False)  # Summary table
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=True)   # Detailed metrics
Copy
```

The summary shows:
- Pages crawled vs. confidence achieved
- Coverage, consistency, and saturation scores
- Crawling efficiency metrics

## Persistence and Resumption

### Saving Progress

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    save_state=True,
    state_path="my_crawl_state.json"
)

# Crawl will auto-save progress
result = await adaptive.digest(start_url, query)
Copy
```

### Resuming a Crawl

```
# Resume from saved state
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url,
    query,
    resume_from="my_crawl_state.json"
)
Copy
```

### Exporting Knowledge Base

```
# Export collected pages to JSONL
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")

# Import into another session
new_adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)
new_adaptive.import_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")
Copy
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Query Formulation

* Use specific, descriptive queries
* Include key terms you expect to find
* Avoid overly broad queries

### 2. Threshold Tuning

* Start with default (0.7) for general use
* Lower to 0.5-0.6 for exploratory crawling
* Raise to 0.8+ for exhaustive coverage

### 3. Performance Optimization

* Use appropriate `max_pages` limits
* Adjust `top_k_links` based on site structure
* Enable caching for repeat crawls

### 4. Link Selection

* The crawler prioritizes links based on:
* Relevance to query
* Expected information gain
* URL structure and depth

## Examples

### Research Assistant

```
# Gather information about a programming concept
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="python decorators implementation patterns"
)

# Get the most relevant excerpts
for doc in adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=3):
    print(f"\nFrom: {doc['url']}")
    print(f"Relevance: {doc['score']:.2%}")
    print(doc['content'][:500] + "...")
Copy
```

### Knowledge Base Builder

```
# Build a focused knowledge base about machine learning
queries = [
    "supervised learning algorithms",
    "neural network architectures", 
    "model evaluation metrics"
]

for query in queries:
    await adaptive.digest(
        start_url="
        query=query
    )

# Export combined knowledge base
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("ml_knowledge.jsonl")
Copy
```

### API Documentation Crawler

```
# Intelligently crawl API documentation
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.85,  # Higher threshold for completeness
    max_pages=30
)

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from traditional crawling?**
A: Traditional crawling follows fixed patterns (BFS/DFS). Adaptive crawling makes intelligent decisions about which links to follow and when to stop based on information gain.

**Q: Can I use this with JavaScript-heavy sites?**
A: Yes! AdaptiveCrawler inherits all capabilities from AsyncWebCrawler, including JavaScript execution.

**Q: How does it handle large websites?**
A: The algorithm naturally limits crawling to relevant sections. Use `max_pages` as a safety limit.

**Q: Can I customize the scoring algorithms?**
A: Advanced users can implement custom strategies. See [Adaptive Strategies](../../advanced/adaptive-strategies/).

# Deep Crawling

One of Crawl4AI's most powerful features is its ability to perform **configurable deep crawling** that can explore websites beyond a single page. With fine-tuned control over crawl depth, domain boundaries, and content filtering, Crawl4AI gives you the tools to extract precisely the content you need.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

1. How to set up a **Basic Deep Crawler** with BFS strategy
2. Understanding the difference between **streamed and non-streamed** output
3. Implementing **filters and scorers** to target specific content
4. Creating **advanced filtering chains** for sophisticated crawls
5. Using **BestFirstCrawling** for intelligent exploration prioritization

> **Prerequisites**  
> - You’ve completed or read [AsyncWebCrawler Basics](../simple-crawling/) to understand how to run a simple crawl.  
> - You know how to configure `CrawlerRunConfig`.

---

## 1. Quick Example

Here's a minimal code snippet that implements a basic deep crawl using the **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy

async def main():
    # Configure a 2-level deep crawl
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
            max_depth=2, 
            include_external=False
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        verbose=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

        print(f"Crawled {len(results)} pages in total")

        # Access individual results
        for result in results[:3]:  # Show first 3 results
            print(f"URL: {result.url}")
            print(f"Depth: {result.metadata.get('depth', 0)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**What's happening?**  
- `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=2, include_external=False)` instructs Crawl4AI to:
- Crawl the starting page (depth 0) plus 2 more levels
- Stay within the same domain (don't follow external links)
- Each result contains metadata like the crawl depth
- Results are returned as a list after all crawling is complete

---

## 2. Understanding Deep Crawling Strategy Options

### 2.1 BFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Breadth-First Search)

The **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a breadth-first approach, exploring all links at one depth before moving deeper:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=50,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.3,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.2 DFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Depth-First Search)

The **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a depth-first approach, explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import DFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=30,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.5,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.3 BestFirstCrawlingStrategy (⭐️ - Recommended Deep crawl strategy)

For more intelligent crawling, use **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy** with scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

# Create a scorer
scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7
)

# Configure the strategy
strategy = BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    include_external=False,
    url_scorer=scorer,
    max_pages=25,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
)
Copy
```

This crawling approach:
- Evaluates each discovered URL based on scorer criteria
- Visits higher-scoring pages first
- Helps focus crawl resources on the most relevant content
- Can limit total pages crawled with `max_pages`
- Does not need `score_threshold` as it naturally prioritizes by score

---

## 3. Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Results

Crawl4AI can return results in two modes:

### 3.1 Non-Streaming Mode (Default)

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=False  # Default behavior
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Wait for ALL results to be collected before returning
    results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

    for result in results:
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**When to use non-streaming mode:**
- You need the complete dataset before processing
- You're performing batch operations on all results together
- Crawl time isn't a critical factor

### 3.2 Streaming Mode

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=True  # Enable streaming
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Returns an async iterator
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        # Process each result as it becomes available
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**Benefits of streaming mode:**
- Process results immediately as they're discovered
- Start working with early results while crawling continues
- Better for real-time applications or progressive display
- Reduces memory pressure when handling many pages

---

## 4. Filtering Content with Filter Chains

Filters help you narrow down which pages to crawl. Combine multiple filters using **FilterChain** for powerful targeting.

### 4.1 Basic URL Pattern Filter

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, URLPatternFilter

# Only follow URLs containing "blog" or "docs"
url_filter = URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*blog*", "*docs*"])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([url_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.2 Combining Multiple Filters

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    URLPatternFilter,
    DomainFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)

# Create a chain of filters
filter_chain = FilterChain([
    # Only follow URLs with specific patterns
    URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*"]),

    # Only crawl specific domains
    DomainFilter(
        allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
        blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
    ),

    # Only include specific content types
    ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        filter_chain=filter_chain
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.3 Available Filter Types

Crawl4AI includes several specialized filters:

* **`URLPatternFilter`**: Matches URL patterns using wildcard syntax
* **`DomainFilter`**: Controls which domains to include or exclude
* **`ContentTypeFilter`**: Filters based on HTTP Content-Type
* **`ContentRelevanceFilter`**: Uses similarity to a text query
* **`SEOFilter`**: Evaluates SEO elements (meta tags, headers, etc.)

---

## 5. Using Scorers for Prioritized Crawling

Scorers assign priority values to discovered URLs, helping the crawler focus on the most relevant content first.

### 5.1 KeywordRelevanceScorer

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy

# Create a keyword relevance scorer
keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7  # Importance of this scorer (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        url_scorer=keyword_scorer
    ),
    stream=True  # Recommended with BestFirstCrawling
)

# Results will come in order of relevance score
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
        print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")
Copy
```

**How scorers work:**
- Evaluate each discovered URL before crawling
- Calculate relevance based on various signals
- Help the crawler make intelligent choices about traversal order

---

## 6. Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 6.1 SEO Filter for Quality Assessment

The **SEOFilter** helps you identify pages with strong SEO characteristics:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, SEOFilter

# Create an SEO filter that looks for specific keywords in page metadata
seo_filter = SEOFilter(
    threshold=0.5,  # Minimum score (0.0 to 1.0)
    keywords=["tutorial", "guide", "documentation"]
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([seo_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 6.2 Content Relevance Filter

The **ContentRelevanceFilter** analyzes the actual content of pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, ContentRelevanceFilter

# Create a content relevance filter
relevance_filter = ContentRelevanceFilter(
    query="Web crawling and data extraction with Python",
    threshold=0.7  # Minimum similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([relevance_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

This filter:
- Measures semantic similarity between query and page content
- It's a BM25-based relevance filter using head section content

---

## 7. Building a Complete Advanced Crawler

This example combines multiple techniques for a sophisticated crawl:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    DomainFilter,
    URLPatternFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

async def run_advanced_crawler():
    # Create a sophisticated filter chain
    filter_chain = FilterChain([
        # Domain boundaries
        DomainFilter(
            allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
            blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
        ),

        # URL patterns to include
        URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*", "*blog*"]),

        # Content type filtering
        ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
    ])

    # Create a relevance scorer
    keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
        keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
        weight=0.7
    )

    # Set up the configuration
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
            max_depth=2,
            include_external=False,
            filter_chain=filter_chain,
            url_scorer=keyword_scorer
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        stream=True,
        verbose=True
    )

    # Execute the crawl
    results = []
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
            results.append(result)
            score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
            depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
            print(f"Depth: {depth} | Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")

    # Analyze the results
    print(f"Crawled {len(results)} high-value pages")
    print(f"Average score: {sum(r.metadata.get('score', 0) for r in results) / len(results):.2f}")

    # Group by depth
    depth_counts = {}
    for result in results:
        depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
        depth_counts[depth] = depth_counts.get(depth, 0) + 1

    print("Pages crawled by depth:")
    for depth, count in sorted(depth_counts.items()):

## 8. Limiting and Controlling Crawl Size

### 8.1 Using max\_pages

You can limit the total number of pages crawled with the `max_pages` parameter:

```
# Limit to exactly 20 pages regardless of depth
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=3,
    max_pages=20
)
Copy
```

This feature is useful for:
- Controlling API costs
- Setting predictable execution times
- Focusing on the most important content
- Testing crawl configurations before full execution

### 8.2 Using score\_threshold

For BFS and DFS strategies, you can set a minimum score threshold to only crawl high-quality pages:

```
# Only follow links with scores above 0.4
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    url_scorer=KeywordRelevanceScorer(keywords=["api", "guide", "reference"]),
    score_threshold=0.4  # Skip URLs with scores below this value
)
Copy
```

Note that for BestFirstCrawlingStrategy, score\_threshold is not needed since pages are already processed in order of highest score first.

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Tips

1.**Set realistic limits.** Be cautious with `max_depth` values > 3, which can exponentially increase crawl size. Use `max_pages` to set hard limits.

2.**Don't neglect the scoring component.** BestFirstCrawling works best with well-tuned scorers. Experiment with keyword weights for optimal prioritization.

3.**Be a good web citizen.** Respect robots.txt. (disabled by default)

4.**Handle page errors gracefully.** Not all pages will be accessible. Check `result.status` when processing results.

5.**Balance breadth vs. depth.** Choose your strategy wisely - BFS for comprehensive coverage, DFS for deep exploration, BestFirst for focused relevance-based crawling.

---

## 10. Summary & Next Steps

In this **Deep Crawling with Crawl4AI** tutorial, you learned to:

* Configure **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, and **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy**
* Process results in streaming or non-streaming mode
* Apply filters to target specific content
* Use scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages
* Limit crawls with `max_pages` and `score_threshold` parameters
* Build a complete advanced crawler with combined techniques

With these tools, you can efficiently extract structured data from websites at scale, focusing precisely on the content you need for your specific use case.

USER QUESTION: whats difference between bfs and adaptive crawl, like conceptually. show me code for both

You are an expert assistant. Using only the current webpage content below, answer the user's question by quoting the relevant passage, code block, or table WORD-FOR-WORD, including ALL formatting, indentation, and line breaks. DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or shorten ANY part of the quoted answer, unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize giving the most detailed answer possible by quoting the all relevant text from the content. If the content has numbers, prices, code, tables, or other specific details, quote them exactly as they appear. If multiple relevant passages are found, include ALL of them in their entirety, word-for-word. ALWAYS provide which page they should visit to find the exact information they are looking for, if possible, by saying 'Please visit [page URL] for the full details.'

They never elaborate on exactly how these creatures hear. Throughout the films, they act like they hear like we do and locate things that emit sound. But then they gave them this unfolding head and clicking noise which suggests they use echolocation, which is TOTALLY different. If these things used Echolocation, then staying quiet wouldn't matter. 

Echolocation works like radar, bouncing soundwaves off surfaces and then being able to make objects out based on those waves. Depending on their sensitivity, they'd be able to see a Human there in front of them just by clicking and hearing the return.

1. I watch AQP: Day One
2. I imagine what a game set in that universe would be like
3. I find out there actually is a game set in that universe
4. The next day my favorite YT'er uploads a video playing the game

Funny that you mention the hospital smell. I once worked in one as a beautifully named "environmental specialist" (aka janitor) and they do indeed use a specific chemical that purifies the air to minimize the spread of sickness. This is why the entire staff isn't constantly ill despite working directly with sick people. There are cleaning products for the home with this same chemical but not many, weirdly enough.

The end of the intro really makes me wonder why people dont carry things to throw around more. Just a rock or bottle to distract them.

Best place to live in this scenario is a meadow. The creatures would be driven nuts by the sounds of crickets and cicadas that they can't silence.

I like how as you traverse the world you see other ppl dealing with the situation as well. Like in the facility there’s ppl hiding and trying to be quiet and being chased. Like you’re not the only person in this world like a lot of games do. Outside of interactions and plot a lot of games make you feel like you’re the only person in the world
