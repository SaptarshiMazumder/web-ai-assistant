Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Desktop
Mobile
Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Select Video effects.

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed.

Select Add new  to upload and use an image from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

Select Preview to view the background before you apply it.

Select Apply.

Notes: 

Linux users aren't able to use this feature.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    adaptive_crawler = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
    state = await adaptive_crawler.digest(
        start_url="
        query="latest news content"
    )
# Crawler learns patterns and improves extraction over time

🌊 Virtual Scroll Support: Complete content extraction from infinite scroll pages:

scroll_config = VirtualScrollConfig(
    container_selector="[data-testid='feed']",
    scroll_count=20,
    scroll_by="container_height",

result = await crawler.arun(url, config=CrawlerRunConfig(
    link_preview_config=link_config,
    score_links=True
))
# Links ranked by relevance and quality

🎣 Async URL Seeder: Discover thousands of URLs in seconds:

seeder = AsyncUrlSeeder(SeedingConfig(
    source="sitemap+cc",
    pattern="*/blog/*",
    query="python tutorials",

React Hooks : A Comprehensive Beginner’s Guide

Introduction

React is an open-source JavaScript-based user interface library, highly popular for web and mobile app development. It adheres to the principle of component-based architecture, where a component serves as an isolated and reusable piece of code. Components in React can be classified into two types: class components and functional components.

Before version 16.8, React developers could only manage state and other features using class components. However, with the introduction of version 16.8, React introduced a new pattern known as Hooks. Hooks enable developers to utilize state and other React features within functional components, empowering them to apply functional programming principles in React.

Throughout this article, we will delve into the fundamentals of React Hooks, exploring core concepts such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and the art of crafting custom hooks. By the end, you'll not only grasp the syntax and usage of Hooks but also gain a deeper appreciation for their role in streamlining React development.

Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that enable functional components to “hook into” React features like state and life-cycle methods. They provide a more flexible and straightforward way to manage component logic, allowing developers to encapsulate behavior within functional components without using the class syntax.

Before the introduction of Hooks, managing state and side effects in React components was primarily done using class components. However, class components come with their own set of complexities, such as handling this binding, and this lead to verbose code. Hooks were introduced to fix these problems and give an easier way to handle component logic.

React Hooks offer several advantages over class components. Here are some of the key advantages:

Simplified Syntax: Hooks offer cleaner and more concise code compared to class components.
Reusability: Hooks enable the creation of custom reusable logic, enhancing modularity.
Improved Readability: Co-locating logic with components improves code readability and reduces cognitive load.
No this Keyword: Hooks eliminate the need for this, reducing confusion and potential bugs.
Better Performance Optimization: Hooks enable React to optimize functional components more effectively.
Easier Testing: Functional components with Hooks are easier to test compared to class components.
Support for Functional Programming: Hooks encourage functional programming principles, leading to more predictable and maintainable code.
A Practical View

Now that we’ve discussed the two methods for creating React components — using functions and classes — let’s start by creating a simple class component. This component will display a counter with a button to increase the count. Afterward, we’ll convert it to a functional component using hooks and observe the differences.

Component without Hook: Class Component

import React, { Component } from 'react';

class CounterClass extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
    this.incrementCount = this.incrementCount.bind(this);
  }

  incrementCount() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      count: prevState.count + 1
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Counter (Class Component)</h2>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.incrementCount}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default CounterClass;

Components with Hook:Functional Component:

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function CounterFunction() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Counter (Function Component)</h2>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CounterFunction;

Both the class component and the functional component with Hooks achieve the same functionality — they both render a counter with a button to increment the count. You can experiment with both codes in practice.

In this practical comparison, we can see how the function component with Hooks achieves the same functionality as the class component but with less boilerplate code. The Hook’s version offers a more concise and readable implementation, demonstrating the simplicity and effectiveness of React Hooks.

Core React Hooks

When developing React applications, understanding the core React Hooks is paramount. These hooks, including useState, useEffect, and useContext, form the foundation for managing state and side effects within functional components. Each hook serves a specific purpose, offering developers powerful tools to streamline their development workflow and create robust, efficient applications.

In this section, we will explore each of these core React Hooks in detail, diving into their syntax, usage, and practical applications.

useState Hook

The useState hook is a fundamental tool in React for managing state within functional components. Prior to the introduction of hooks, state management was primarily handled in class components. However, with the useState hook, functional components gain the ability to manage state in a straightforward and concise manner.

The useState hook is used by importing it from the React library. It is then invoked within the functional component, typically during initialization. The hook returns an array containing the current state value and a function to update that state.

import React, { useState } from "react";

function FormComponent() {
  // Declare state variables for each input field
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("");
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [formSubmitted, setFormSubmitted] = useState(false);

  // Event handler for form submission
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Set formSubmitted state to true
    setFormSubmitted(true);
    // Do something with the form data, e.g., submit to a server
    console.log("Form submitted:", { firstName, lastName, email });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="firstName">First Name:</label>
          <input
            type="text"
            id="firstName"
            name="firstName"
            value={firstName}
            onChange={(e) => setFirstName(e.target.value)}
          />
        </div>
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="lastName">Last Name:</label>
          <input
            type="text"
            id="lastName"
            name="lastName"
            value={lastName}
            onChange={(e) => setLastName(e.target.value)}
          />
        </div>
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
          <input
            type="email"
            id="email"
            name="email"
            value={email}
            onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
          />
        </div>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
      {formSubmitted && (
        <div>
          <h2>Form Submitted States:</h2>
          <p>First Name: {firstName}</p>
          <p>Last Name: {lastName}</p>
          <p>Email: {email}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default FormComponent;

In this example, the useState hook is used to manage both the state of the form input fields (firstName, lastName, and email) and the state to track the form submission status (formSubmitted). Each input field is associated with its own state variable, enabling dynamic updates through the onChange event handler. Upon form submission, the formSubmitted state is toggled to true, triggering the display of the submitted form states.

useEffect Hook

The useEffect hook in React allows developers to perform side effects in functional components. These side effects can include fetching data from an API, subscribing to events, updating the DOM, and more.

useEffect is called after every render of the component, and it enables React developers to encapsulate logic that needs to be executed in response to certain conditions, such as component mount, unmount, or updates to specific props or state variables. This hook takes two arguments: a function containing the side effect logic, and an optional array of dependencies that specify when the effect should be re-executed.

useEffect with No Dependencies

When the useEffect hook is used without specifying any dependencies, it runs after the initial render and on every subsequent re-render.

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function CounterComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Effect without dependencies: runs after initial render and on every re-render
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect has been triggered')
    // Update document title with the current count
    document.title = `Clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Click the button to increase count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase Count</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CounterComponent;

The useEffect function updates the document title with the current count value, ensuring it reflects the number of times the button has been clicked. When the button is clicked, the setCount function updates the state, triggering a re-render of the component and the execution of useEffect, which updates the document title again.

This component demonstrates the use of the useEffect hook to perform side effects (updating the document title) that should occur after every render, without depending on any specific variables or state values.

useEffect with Empty Dependency Array

The useEffect hook with an empty dependency array ([]) is used to perform side effects that should only occur once, after the initial render of the component. This means the effect runs only after the component mounts, and it doesn't depend on any variables or state.

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function TimerComponent() {
  const [timer, setTimer] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Setup subscription to a timer when compnent mounts
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setTimer(prevTimer => prevTimer + 1);
    }, 1000);

    // Cleanup function: Clear the subscription when component unmounts
    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Timer: {timer}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TimerComponent;

In this component, we utilize the useState hook to create a timer state variable for tracking elapsed time in secs. Within the useEffect hook, we establish a timer subscription using setInterval, incrementing the timer value every second. To prevent memory leaks, a cleanup function utilizing clearInterval is returned to clear the subscription upon component unmount.

With an empty dependency array ([]), the effect runs only once after the initial render, ensuring proper setup of the timer subscription. Finally, the component displays the current timer value in a paragraph element.

useEffect With Dependencies

When using the useEffect hook with dependencies, the effect will run after the initial render and then re-run whenever any of the dependencies change. This is useful for scenarios where you want to perform certain actions based on changes to specific variables or state values.

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function CounterComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count has changed:', count);
  }, [count]); // Dependency array with 'count'

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase Count</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CounterComponent;

In this component, we initialize a counter variable count using useState. The useEffect hook is configured with a dependency array [count], so it runs whenever count changes. Inside the effect, we log a message to the console indicating the change in count. Clicking the button updates count, triggering the effect again. If there were multiple dependencies specified in the array, the effect would run whenever any of them change. This allows React developers to perform actions in response to changes in specific variables or state values.

In summary, the useEffect hook in React is exclusively used within function components and custom hooks to manage side effects. It allows developers to perform actions in response to changes in variables, state, or component lifecycle events. By specifying dependencies, developers can control when the effect runs, ensuring efficient execution. Cleanup functions can also be utilized to manage resource cleanup or subscription unsubscription.

useContext Hook

useContext is a React hook that offers a means to share data (context) across multiple components without explicitly passing it through props, thereby addressing the issue of prop drilling. It is part of the React Context API, which is integrated into the React library.

By utilizing useContext, components can consume context values provided by a Provider higher up in the component tree, eliminating the need to pass data through intermediate components. This approach streamlines code and improves scalability.

In a typical React project, you would organize your code into different files and folders. Here’s how the project might be structured:

src/
|-- components/
|   |-- ThemedComponent.jsx      // Contains ThemedComponent code
|-- contexts/
|   |-- ThemeContext.jsx           // Contains ThemeContext code
|-- App.jsx         
|-- main.jsx 
//ThemedComponent.jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { ThemeContext } from '../contexts/ThemeContext';

const ThemedComponent = () => {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Theme: {theme}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ThemedComponent;
//ThemeContext.jsx
import React, { createContext } from 'react';

export const ThemeContext = createContext();

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const theme = 'light'; // For simplicity, hardcoding the theme here
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
//App.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ThemedComponent from './components/ThemedComponent';
import { ThemeProvider } from './contexts/ThemeContext';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <ThemedComponent />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

export default App;

In the provided code, the useContext hook is used within the ThemedComponent functional component to directly consume the theme context from the ThemeContext.Provider. This approach simplifies data access by eliminating the need for prop drilling or callback functions

By utilizing useContext, the component becomes independent of the specific location where the context is defined, enhancing its reusability and maintainability. Moreover, useContext facilitates cleaner component code, as it abstracts away the complexities of context usage, leading to more comprehensible components.

useReducer Hook

This hook is used for managing complex state logic in a more organized and predictable way. It is especially beneficial when dealing with state objects that have multiple properties or when state transitions depend on the previous state

The useReducer hook in React takes two arguments: a reducer function and an initial state value. The reducer function specifies how the state should be updated based on the action dispatched to it, taking the current state and action as arguments and returning the new state. The initial state value represents the starting state of the component and can be a simple value, object, or array.

import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

// Define the reducer function
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const Counter = () => {
  // Initialize state using useReducer
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;

In this example, we utilize the useReducer hook to manage state in a React component. We start by defining a reducer function that handles state updates based on dispatched actions. Next, we initialize the state using useReducer, passing the reducer function and initial state as arguments. This hook returns an array containing the current state and a dispatch function.

Within the component, we render the current count value from the state object and two buttons that dispatch INCREMENT and DECREMENT actions. When an action is dispatched, the reducer function updates the state accordingly, triggering a re-render of the component with the updated state.

useCallback Hook

useCallback hook in React is used to memoize functions, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders caused by function recreations. When a function is wrapped with useCallback, React will return the same memoized function reference on subsequent renders as long as the dependencies listed in the dependency array remain unchanged.

The useCallback hook takes two arguments: the callback function and an array of dependencies. If any of the dependencies in the array change, the callback function is re-created; otherwise, the cached version of the function is returned.

import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

//CounterButton.jsx
const CounterButton = ({ onClick }) => {
  console.log('Rendering CounterButton');
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me!</button>;
};

//App.jsx
const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Define a memoized callback function using useCallback
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  }, []); // No dependencies, the function is created only once

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <CounterButton onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

In this example, we utilize the useCallback hook to create a memoized callback function named handleClick. This function increments the count state by 1 when invoked. By specifying an empty dependency array [], we ensure that handleClick is memoized and created only once, returning the same function reference on subsequent renders. This optimization prevents unnecessary re-renders of the CounterButton component, as it no longer reacts to changes in the handleClick function reference. As a result, the application's performance is improved by avoiding unnecessary component re-renders.

useMemo hook

useMemo hook in React is used to memoize the result of a computation, optimizing performance by caching expensive calculations and returning the cached value when the dependencies remain unchanged.

It takes a function as its first argument, which computes the value to be memoized, and an array of dependencies as its second argument. When any of the dependencies change, the memoized value is recalculated.

import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

const fibonacci = n => {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
};

const App = () => {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(20);
  const [otherState, setOtherState] = useState(false);

  // Memoize the result of the fibonacci calculation
  const fibResult = useMemo(() => fibonacci(number), [number]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Calculate Fibonacci Number</h1>
      <p>Number: {number}</p>
      <p>Fibonacci Result: {fibResult}</p>
      <p>Other State: {otherState.toString()}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setNumber(prevNumber => prevNumber + 1)}>
        Increment Number
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => setOtherState(prevState => !prevState)}>
        Toggle State
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

In this example, we utilize the useMemo hook to optimize the performance of a Fibonacci calculation within a React functional component. The component manages a number state representing the input to the Fibonacci calculation using the useState hook. By employing useMemo, we memoize the result of the Fibonacci calculation based on the number state. This ensures that the expensive computation is only performed when the number state changes, preventing unnecessary recalculations during component re-renders.

When we click on the “Toggle State” button, the App component re-renders due to the state update of otherState. However, despite the component re-rendering, the Fibonacci calculation is not recomputed unnecessarily. This is because useMemo memoizes the result of the Fibonacci calculation based on the number state, which remains unchanged when toggling otherState.

useRef Hook

useRef hook in React is used to create a mutable reference that persists across re-renders of the component. Unlike useState, changes to a useRef value do not trigger a re-render of the component. useRef is commonly used to access and interact with DOM elements or to persist values across renders without triggering re-renders.

import React, { useRef } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleFocus = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

In this example, we utilize the useRef hook to create a reference named inputRef, which is then assigned to the ref attribute of an input element. When the "Focus Input" button is clicked, invoking the handleFocus function, the input element gains focus via inputRef.current.focus(). Despite this focus action, the component does not re-render because useRef does not trigger re-renders.

Other React Hooks

useLayoutEffect Hook: is similar to useEffect, but it’s executed synchronously after all DOM mutations have been applied but before the browser paints the changes on the screen. This makes it suitable for tasks that require measurements or DOM manipulations and need to be performed before the user sees the updates.

useDebugValue hook: is a React hook that is used to provide additional debug information about custom hooks in React DevTools. It allows you to display custom labels and values for custom hooks in the React DevTools inspector, making it easier to debug and understand how custom hooks are being used in your application.

useImperativeHandle hook: is used to customize the instance value that is exposed by a parent component when using the forwardRef feature in React. It allows child components to expose specific methods or properties to their parent components, providing a way to interact with the child component's instance from its parent.

Custom Hooks

Custom hooks in React are JavaScript functions that utilize one or more built-in React hooks to encapsulate and share reusable logic across components. They allow developers to abstract complex logic into reusable pieces, promoting code reusability and composability.

They must follow a naming convention where their names start with the prefix “use”. This convention is enforced by React’s ESLint rules to help developers distinguish between regular functions and custom hooks.

Let’s create a useFetch custom hook that enables us to fetch data from a specified URL and handle loading states and errors.

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error('Failed to fetch data');
        }
        const jsonData = await response.json();
        setData(jsonData);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}

export default useFetch;

This custom hook useFetch takes a URL as its parameter and returns an object containing the fetched data (data), a boolean flag indicating whether the data is still loading (loading), and any error that may occur during the fetch (error).

You can use this custom hook in your components like this:

import React from 'react';
import useFetch from './useFetch';

function MyComponent() {
  const { data, loading, error } = useFetch('

  if (loading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data:</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;

With this custom hook, you can easily fetch data from any API endpoint in your React components while handling loading states and errors in a clean and reusable manner.

Summary

React hooks have ushered in a new era of efficiency and effectiveness in web development. With hooks like useReducer for state management and useMemo and useCallback for performance optimization, developers can unlock new levels of productivity and innovation.

They are not limited to experts; developers of all skill levels can leverage these tools. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or new to React, integrating these hooks into your projects can simplify code, improve performance, and elevate user experiences.

In summary, React hooks are indispensable for React developers aiming to build faster and more responsive web applications.

From Triumph in Iran to Starvation in Gaza: Netanyahu Squanders His Moment to Halt the War

Six weeks after Benjamin Netanyahu scored a victory over Iran, the Israeli leader is now pushing for an “all or nothing” deal with Hamas. But he has not made the compromises needed to make it happen.

Reporting from Jerusalem

Aug. 4, 2025
Updated 7:10 a.m. ET

When Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, led the country to a military victory over Iran in June, both his allies and rivals portrayed it as his finest achievement. Flush with newfound confidence and authority, Mr. Netanyahu seemed finally to have gained the political capital he needed to override opposition from his far-right government allies to reach a truce in Gaza.

Six weeks later, the prime minister has squandered that moment. The talks between Hamas and Israel are, once again, stuck. Israel is now pushing for a deal to end the war in one go, instead of in phases. But like Hamas, Mr. Netanyahu has refused to make the compromises needed for such a deal to work — and the credit that he accrued in June has evaporated, both domestically and overseas.

International condemnation of the growing starvation in Gaza, which aid agencies and many foreign government have largely blamed on Israel’s 11-week blockade on the territory this year, is at its peak. Partly to protest Israel’s responsibility for that situation, several longstanding allies of Israel have pledged to recognize a Palestinian state in the near future.

Amid the tangled streets of Beirut’s southern reaches, mournful Hezbollah followers have turned the mausoleum of Hassan Nasrallah, the group’s leader for more than 30 years, into a pilgrimage site.

His grave, a white marble slab engraved with Quranic verses, is sheltered by a canopy adorned with white and yellow artificial flowers. Around it, men and women pray separately on a patchwork of carpets.

Mr. Nasrallah was assassinated in the fallout from the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which set off the war in Gaza. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah opened a second front in solidarity with Hamas by firing across the Lebanon-Israel border. The conflict eventually escalated into a full blown war, during which Israel eliminated Hezbollah’s leadership.

## Hundreds Protest in Tel Aviv After Hostage Videos Surface From Gaza

#### The circulation of videos created by Hamas showing Israeli hostages living in dire conditions incited families to protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand a cease-fire and the return of their loved ones.

:   Special Envoy Steve Witkoff told us clearly that Netanyahu is committed to ending the war. We now understand that the statements issued by political sources two days ago, claiming a comprehensive deal is on the table, were empty slogans. The preconditions set by Israel are unrealistic and unworkable. We will not get our children back unless the Israeli government places a real initiative, a real initiative on the table.

From Triumph in Iran to Starvation in Gaza: Netanyahu Squanders His Moment to Halt the War

Six weeks after Benjamin Netanyahu scored a victory over Iran, the Israeli leader is now pushing for an “all or nothing” deal with Hamas. But he has not made the compromises needed to make it happen.

When Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, led the country to a military victory over Iran in June, both his allies and rivals portrayed it as his finest achievement. Flush with newfound confidence and authority, Mr. Netanyahu seemed finally to have gained the political capital he needed to override opposition from his far-right government allies to reach a truce in Gaza.

Six weeks later, the prime minister has squandered that moment. The talks between Hamas and Israel are, once again, stuck. Israel is now pushing for a deal to end the war in one go, instead of in phases. But like Hamas, Mr. Netanyahu has refused to make the compromises needed for such a deal to work — and the credit that he accrued in June has evaporated, both domestically and overseas.

International condemnation of the growing starvation in Gaza, which aid agencies and many foreign government have largely blamed on Israel’s 11-week blockade on the territory this year, is at its peak. Partly to protest Israel’s responsibility for that situation, several longstanding allies of Israel have pledged to recognize a Palestinian state in the near future.

For months, the Israeli government had focused on negotiating a two-phased deal for a 60-day cease-fire in Gaza and the release of some hostages, leaving discussions about a permanent end to the war for a later stage.

With the talks now at an impasse, American and Israeli officials appear to be sharply changing their tone by signaling that they will push for a comprehensive deal. But Israel and Hamas remain far apart, and analysts said this new approach would also face steep challenges.

The shift, at least in rhetoric, comes as the Israeli government faces rising domestic pressure to secure the release of hostages still held in Gaza. Israel believes that about 20 are still alive and that the bodies of 30 others remain in the enclave. Videos released over the weekend showed two living captives looking emaciated and frail, shocking many Israelis and sparking fear among the hostages’ families.

The Israeli government has also come under mounting international criticism over the mass hunger that has spread through Gaza’s population of about two million people after Israel imposed strict restrictions in recent months on the entry of aid.

Israel has continued launching military strikes on Gaza, even as it has facilitated the entry of more aid into Gaza in recent days. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said on Sunday that Israeli artillery had hit its offices in Khan Younis, killing one of the aid group’s staffers and injuring others. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.

Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s special envoy to the Middle East, who is visiting the region, met with families of Israeli hostages on Saturday and told them that President Trump now wants to see all the living hostages released at once.

Some of Israel’s most important Western allies, under political pressure from voters appalled by mounting evidence of starvation in Gaza, now say that they will recognize a Palestinian state. President Trump, himself convinced that Gazans are starving, has sent his Mideast envoy to Israel for the first time in months to look at the chaotic food distribution system.

More scholars are debating whether Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Opinion polls in the United States and elsewhere show an increasingly negative view of Israel. And there is no clear plan to bring the war against Hamas to an end.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has responded angrily to the growing skepticism. He has said that the reports of starvation are exaggerated, that Hamas must be destroyed, that critics are often antisemites and that Western recognition of a Palestinian state is a reward to Hamas for the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed more than 1,000 people.

“The usual Israeli view is that this crisis is another temporary problem,” said Natan Sachs, an analyst of Israeli politics. “But that’s a misreading of the world, because it’s accelerating a global turn against Israel that has dramatic effects, especially among young people.”

As anger grows over widespread hunger in Gaza, Israel risks becoming an international outcast. The deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel in 2023 remains a vivid, salient event for many Israelis. But for others around the world, the devastation and hunger in Gaza have become more visible and urgent.

Some of Israel’s most important Western allies, under political pressure from voters appalled by mounting evidence of starvation in Gaza, now say that they will recognize a Palestinian state. President Trump, himself convinced that Gazans are starving, has sent his Mideast envoy to Israel for the first time in months to look at the chaotic food distribution system.

More scholars are debating whether Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Opinion polls in the United States and elsewhere show an increasingly negative view of Israel. And there is no clear plan to bring the war against Hamas to an end.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has responded angrily to the growing skepticism. He has said that the reports of starvation are exaggerated, that Hamas must be destroyed, that critics are often antisemites and that Western recognition of a Palestinian state is a reward to Hamas for the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed more than 1,000 people.

“The usual Israeli view is that this crisis is another temporary problem,” said Natan Sachs, an analyst of Israeli politics. “But that’s a misreading of the world, because it’s accelerating a global turn against Israel that has dramatic effects, especially among young people.”

As anger grows over widespread hunger in Gaza, Israel risks becoming an international outcast. The deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel in 2023 remains a vivid, salient event for many Israelis. But for others around the world, the devastation and hunger in Gaza have become more visible and urgent.

The family of Evyatar David, an Israeli held hostage in Gaza, saw him for the first time in months on Friday evening in a video circulated by his Hamas captors. He was emaciated and sallow in what appeared to be an underground tunnel.

The video prompted an outpouring of fear and horror among the families of the dozens of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza nearly two years after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and ignited the war.

“Our brothers are turning into skin and bones at this very moment,” Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan was one of about 250 people taken hostage during the Hamas assault, said at a rally on Saturday. Her son is believed to still be alive.

More than 100 hostages were freed during two brief cease-fires, the last of which ended in March. Israeli forces have found the corpses of some other hostages as they have swept through Gaza. Israel believes that about 20 hostages are still alive and that nearly 30 are presumed dead.

In a screenshot from a video circulated by Hamas, Evyatar David is seen emaciated and sallow in what appears to be an underground tunnel.

Cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas to free more hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners have stalled. Last month, Israeli and American negotiators left Doha, Qatar, where most of the talks have been held, without a breakthrough.

Most countries in the United Nations — 147 out of 193 — already recognize a Palestinian state, which currently has observer status at the U.N.

Then, in the course of just the past week, three more countries — all major U.S. allies — said they would join their ranks.

First, France said it would recognize a Palestinian state in September, and in the days that followed, Britain and Canada announced that they, too, were prepared to follow suit. Britain said it would move forward if Israel did not agree to a cease-fire with Hamas in Gaza by September, while Canada tied a final decision to political changes by the Palestinian Authority.

Atef Abu Khater, 17, who was healthy before Gaza was gripped by war, lies in intensive care in a hospital in the north of the Palestinian enclave, suffering from severe malnutrition.

“He is not responding to the treatment,” said his father, A’eed Abu Khater, 48, who has been sheltering in a tent in Gaza City with his wife and five children. “I feel helpless,” he added in a phone call, his voice strained with grief. “We lost our income in the war. Food is unaffordable. There is nothing.”

Gaza’s hospitals have struggled since early in the war to cope with the influx of Palestinians injured and maimed by Israeli airstrikes and, more recently, by shootings meant to disperse desperate crowds as they surge toward food convoys or head to aid distribution sites.

Diego Ibarra Sanchez reported from aboard a Jordanian Air Force C-130.

* Aug. 2, 2025

Airdrops are not known for their precision.

On Thursday, after sweeping over the devastated landscape that is now Gaza, a Jordanian Air Force plane descended and banked. Following a brief countdown, its rear doors opened and, with two crew members tethered at the edge, pallets of food were dispatched to an uncertain fate.

The method is notoriously unreliable, the amount of food insufficient, but Gazans are starving, and so after a hiatus of months, Jordan is one of several countries that have resumed the drops in recent days.

Reporting from Jerusalem

International condemnation of Israel for its nearly two-year-long war in Gaza is growing. Outrage over starvation in the enclave has led to calls from Israel’s allies for a Palestinian state. The U.N. secretary general said the situation was “a moral crisis that is challenging the global conscience.”

And yet there are few more passionate defenders of the country right now than Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, a Baptist minister and the first evangelical Christian to serve in the role.

Even after his boss, President Trump, broke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and acknowledged “real starvation” in Gaza, Mr. Huckabee did not.

“There is hunger and there are some serious issues that need to be addressed,” Mr. Huckabee said this past week at his official residence in central Jerusalem. But, he said, “it’s not like Sudan or Rwanda or other places where there has been mass starvation.” The Gaza Health Ministry has said scores of people, including many children, have died of malnutrition. It is not clear how many also had other illnesses.

The group, backed by Israel and run largely by U.S. contractors, has been widely criticized for shootings by Israeli troops near its food distribution sites.

The world’s Arab countries for the first time have joined unanimously in the call for Hamas to lay down its weapons, release all hostages and end its rule of the Gaza Strip, conditions that they said could help the establishment of a Palestinian state.

The surprise declaration, endorsed on Tuesday by the 22 member nations of the Arab League, also condemned Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, which set off the devastating war in Gaza. The statement came at a United Nations conference in New York on a two-state solution to end the decades-long conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.

“In the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international engagement and support, in line with the objectives of a sovereign and independent Palestinian state,” said the declaration. It was also signed by all 27 European Union states and 17 other countries.

The declaration called for the deployment of “a temporary international stabilization mission,” invited by the Palestinian Authority, which administers part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and “under the aegis of the United Nations.”

Many Arab leaders have working relations with Hamas and rule over populations that are deeply committed to the Palestinian cause. That has made them reluctant to break publicly with the group and to normalize relations with Israel, despite pressure from Western allies like the United States. Qatar hosts Hamas’s political office and some of its political leaders, and has acted as a mediator between the group and both Israel and the United States.

## Hundreds Protest in Tel Aviv After Hostage Videos Surface From Gaza

#### The circulation of videos created by Hamas showing Israeli hostages living in dire conditions incited families to protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand a cease-fire and the return of their loved ones.

:   Special Envoy Steve Witkoff told us clearly that Netanyahu is committed to ending the war. We now understand that the statements issued by political sources two days ago, claiming a comprehensive deal is on the table, were empty slogans. The preconditions set by Israel are unrealistic and unworkable. We will not get our children back unless the Israeli government places a real initiative, a real initiative on the table.

Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s envoy for peace missions, went to the Gaza Strip on Friday and visited an aid distribution site as a hunger crisis in the territory deepens.

Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in the past two months in Gaza while trying to secure aid, which has led to growing international pressure on Israel to ease the humanitarian situation.

Mr. Witkoff posted a photograph on social media of himself and Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, at an aid site overseen by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or G.H.F. The much-criticized, Israel-backed group run by American security contractors has taken over a large part of the aid distribution system in Gaza since May.

“We spent over five hours inside Gaza — level setting the facts on the ground, assessing conditions, and meeting with @GHFUpdates and other agencies,” Mr. Witkoff said in a X post. “The purpose of the visit was to give @POTUS a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza.”

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-story-ad-1)

In his own social media post, Mr. Huckabee said that he and Mr. Witkoff had been briefed by the Israeli military and “spoke to folks on the ground.” It was not immediately clear whom he meant.

Mr. Witkoff was wearing a black “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” hat and a blue flak jacket in photographs included in the post.

Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East envoy, was set to depart for Israel on Wednesday amid mounting international anger over the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, according to a U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter.

Both spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to publicly discuss Mr. Witkoff’s trip, his first known visit to Israel since May, when the United States negotiated the release of the last living American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas in Gaza. This time Mr. Witkoff is expected to arrive in Israel under grimmer circumstances.

Widespread hunger has gripped Gaza’s roughly two million Palestinians, many of whom are displaced after nearly two years of war, after Israel imposed severe restrictions on aid entering the territory and launched a new and contentious system for distributing food and other essential goods. The World Food Program says that more than one in three Palestinians are not eating for multiple consecutive days. And Gaza health officials say dozens of people, including children, have died of starvation in recent weeks.

This week, Mr. Trump publicly acknowledged starvation in Gaza, breaking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who has denied that it is occurring. “That’s real starvation stuff, I see it, and you can’t fake that,” Mr. Trump said on Monday.

Mr. Witkoff is the Trump administration’s lead on negotiations over a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. But those talks stalled last week.

The devastating conditions in the territory have ignited a wave of global outrage at Israel over the past several days. France announced it would recognize Palestinian statehood, a move followed — albeit conditionally — by Britain. A coalition of about 30 countries, including some of Israel’s traditional allies, called last week for an immediate end to the war.

On July 26 the Israeli newspaper Haaretz ran this headline: “Israel at War Day 659. Gaza Medical Sources: At Least 25 Killed by Israeli Gunfire, Some While Waiting for Aid.”

If you had been following this Gaza story closely, you would know that Haaretz was running a similar headline almost every day for weeks — only the number of Palestinians killed while waiting for food aid handed out by Israel in Gaza changed. As I watched these stories pile up, the thought occurred to me that roughly a month earlier Israel had managed to assassinate 10 senior Iranian military officials and 16 nuclear scientists sitting in their homes and offices. So how was it that Israel had the capacity to destroy pinpoint targets in Iran, some 1,200 miles from Tel Aviv, and could not safely deliver boxes of food to starving Gazans 40 miles from Tel Aviv?

That did not seem like an accident. It seemed like the product of something deeper, something quite shameful, playing out within the extremist government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Key figures in Bibi’s extreme-right ruling coalition, like the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, openly pushed a policy that would result in the starvation of many Gazans — to the point where they would leave the strip entirely. Bibi knew the United States wouldn’t let him go that far, so he provided just the bare minimum of aid to prevent being toppled by the Jewish supremacist thugs he’d brought into his government.

Alas, that turned out to be a little too bare, and terrible pictures of malnourished children started emerging from Gaza, prompting even President Trump to declare on Monday that there is “real starvation stuff” happening in Gaza. “You can’t fake that. We have to get the kids fed.”

How did we get here, where a Jewish democratic state, descended in part from the Holocaust, is engaged in a policy of starvation in a war with Hamas that has become the longest and most deadly war between Israelis and Palestinians in Israel’s history — and shows no sign of ending?

My answer: What makes this war different is that it pits what I believe is the worst, most fanatical and amoral government in Israel’s history against the worst, most fanatical, murderous organization in Palestinian history.

When Israel broke its cease-fire with Hamas in March and returned to all-out war in Gaza, the country’s leaders said that the new military campaign and blockade on food would force Hamas to release more Israeli hostages in exchange for fewer Israeli concessions.

Four months later, that campaign is now increasingly perceived, in Israel and beyond, as a strategic, diplomatic and humanitarian failure, especially as starvation rises in Gaza.

In the last four months, Israeli troops have advanced farther into Gaza, mostly recapturing areas they relinquished earlier in the war. They recovered the bodies of eight slain hostages; killed more Hamas leaders, including the group’s top military commander, Muhammad Sinwar; and destroyed more of Hamas’s underground tunnel network.

The move has come at great cost, first and foremost to Palestinian civilians, but also to Israel’s standing in the world — without a breakthrough either in the negotiations with Hamas or on the battlefield. Hamas has refused to surrender, continuing to inflict deadly attacks on Israeli soldiers.

“I have to use these words: total failure,” said Michael Milstein, an Israeli analyst and former military intelligence officer. “We are no closer to achieving our main war goal — to erase the military and the governmental capacities of Hamas — and Hamas has not become more flexible. We find ourselves right now in a total disaster.”

One American-Israeli hostage has been returned alive since the war resumed, but only through a side deal between Hamas and the United States. Hamas remains in control of key urban areas in Gaza, and has not compromised on its core demands. Mr. Sinwar was replaced by another hard-liner, Izz al-Din al-Haddad, who has maintained Hamas’s position, just as Mr. Sinwar had maintained the stance of his own predecessors.

The enduring anguish of the kind of starvation that has taken hold in Gaza lives on in personal and collective memory for generations. Starvation also lives on in the body, especially for the young. For children who survive acute malnutrition, the resulting physical and cognitive damage can last a lifetime.

Those of us who have studied famines over many decades recognize the dreadful signs when social collapse is imminent — when the bonds that tie a community together are fraying and order is breaking down. It is a moment at which death rates grow exponentially and beyond which the fabric of society becomes far more difficult to repair. This disintegration portends chaos and conflict, delinquency and a fierce hopelessness that can breed fresh terrorism. Gaza appears to be passing into that zone now.

It is a calamity that was foreseeable, and foreseen. Starvation takes time; authorities cannot starve a population by accident. Since March of 2024, international bodies have repeatedly warned that Gaza is on the brink of famine. This week a U.N.-backed group issued yet another alert, saying, “The worst-case scenario of famine is playing out.” Food-security experts haven’t had access to the data they would need to make a final judgment about whether conditions in Gaza officially constitute a famine. At this point, the distinction is irrelevant.

Seasoned humanitarian-aid professionals can still bring Gaza back from the brink — if they’re given the chance. For months, Israel has restricted the flow of aid into Gaza, fueling a crisis of hunger that is growing more dire by the day. Food stockpiles were already desperately low in March, when Israel imposed a blockade on the enclave, citing unverified claims that Hamas had been systematically stealing food from the U.N.

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-story-ad-1)

When Israel partly eased restrictions in May, it began operating a new Israeli- and U.S.-backed aid distribution system run by a private group called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, largely displacing traditional aid agencies. This system has so thoroughly ignored conditions on the ground that it raises the question of whether Israel has been intentionally engineering starvation in the strip.

The aid provided by the G.H.F. is inadequate by several standards. The group’s ration boxes, according to nutritionists, are unbalanced and lack nutrients that are essential for starving populations, especially children. A malnourished child requires specialized food such as Plumpy’Nut, a peanut-based therapeutic formula — not pasta or lentils, which the G.H.F. offers instead. The most severely malnourished need intensive care in a hospital. To prepare food included in the ration boxes, people also often require fuel and clean water, both of which are in short supply in Gaza.

I think it’s fair to describe me as a Christian Zionist. I believe in the necessity of the Jewish people to have their own safe, secure homeland. And while I have never thought Israel was perfect (far from it), I have seen the antisemitism and genocidal intent animating its enemies in the Middle East, including Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran.

I can see the extraordinary antisemitism and bias in the larger international community. When a United Nations that includes North Korea, Syria, Russia and China condemns Israel more than any other nation in the world (by far), you know that the Jewish state is being singled out.

I’m also a veteran of the Iraq war who served as judge advocate for an armored cavalry regiment during the surge in Iraq in 2007 and 2008. Before I became a journalist, I was part of a legal team that defended Israel from war crime accusations after Operation Cast Lead, the Gaza war of 2008 and 2009.

Reporting from Jerusalem

* July 27, 2025

Israel said it paused military activity in parts of Gaza on Sunday to allow in international aid, amid growing outrage over the severe hunger faced by Palestinians in the territory.

The decision was a reversal by Israel that followed growing pressure over the dire conditions in Gaza, where nearly one in three people has not been eating “for multiple days in a row,” according to the World Food Program, an arm of the United Nations.

Many countries, including some of Israel’s traditional allies, blame Israel for the widespread hunger crisis. The Israeli government blocked almost all aid to Gaza from March through May in an effort to squeeze concessions from Hamas, and has restricted aid deliveries into the territory since then.

For months, the Israeli government had focused on negotiating a two-phased deal for a 60-day cease-fire in Gaza and the release of some hostages, leaving discussions about a permanent end to the war for a later stage.

With the talks now at an impasse, American and Israeli officials appear to be sharply changing their tone by signaling that they will push for a comprehensive deal. But Israel and Hamas remain far apart, and analysts said this new approach would also face steep challenges.

The shift, at least in rhetoric, comes as the Israeli government faces rising domestic pressure to secure the release of hostages still held in Gaza. Israel believes that about 20 are still alive and that the bodies of 30 others remain in the enclave. Videos released over the weekend showed two living captives looking emaciated and frail, shocking many Israelis and sparking fear among the hostages’ families.

The Israeli government has also come under mounting international criticism over the mass hunger that has spread through Gaza’s population of about two million people after Israel imposed strict restrictions in recent months on the entry of aid.

Israel has continued launching military strikes on Gaza, even as it has facilitated the entry of more aid into Gaza in recent days. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said on Sunday that Israeli artillery had hit its offices in Khan Younis, killing one of the aid group’s staffers and injuring others. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.

Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration’s special envoy to the Middle East, who is visiting the region, met with families of Israeli hostages on Saturday and told them that President Trump now wants to see all the living hostages released at once.

Famine is unfolding across most of Gaza, a U.N.-backed food security group said this week, citing months of severe aid restrictions imposed by Israel on the territory.

“The worst-case scenario of famine is playing out in Gaza,” the group, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or I.P.C., said in a statement. The I.P.C. is an initiative backed by the United Nations, aid agencies and governments.

“Mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths,” the group added, noting that one in three people in Gaza are going without food for days at a time.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, is known as a man who likes to play for time and postpone big decisions. But he may not be able to do that much longer.

Domestically, his coalition partners on the far right threaten to break up the government if he agrees to a cease-fire and does not try to clear Hamas out of Rafah, in southern Gaza.

Militarily, the strategic logic is to complete the dismantling of Hamas by taking Rafah and controlling the border with Egypt. But diplomatically, his allies, especially the United States, are pushing him to agree on a cease-fire, and skip Rafah and the potential civilian casualties a large-scale operation would cause.

So Mr. Netanyahu is now negotiating and maneuvering on several fronts at once, all of which have a significant effect on the conduct of the war and his own future as prime minister.

His recent warnings to Palestinians in parts of Rafah to move to areas Israel has designated as safe, followed late Monday night by the Israeli military’s seizure of the Gazan side of the Egyptian border, signaled to his far-right government coalition, to Hamas and to the Biden administration that he would continue to prioritize Israel’s security interests. More important, Israel’s more narrow war cabinet, which includes senior opposition figures, backed those decisions.

Israel’s 19-day bombing campaign in Gaza has become one of the most intense of the 21st century, prompting growing global scrutiny of its scale, purpose and cost to human life.

Since terrorists from Gaza raided Israel on Oct. 7, killing roughly 1,400 people according to the Israeli government, the Israeli military says it has struck more than 7,000 targets inside Gaza. That is a higher number than in any previous Israeli military campaign in the territory, a narrow enclave less than half the size of New York City. It also outstrips the most intense month of the United States-led bombing campaign against ISIS, according to Airwars, a British conflict monitor.

For Palestinians, the scale of the bombing campaign has appeared vengeful and unfocused, killing Gazans from across a wide spectrum of civilian life and destroying residential areas. The Hamas-run Gazan health ministry says Israeli strikes have killed more than 6,500 people, a number that if verified would make this the deadliest conflict for Palestinians since at least the Lebanon war of 1982.

But to Israelis, there is a necessity and a method to their strikes, which they say are not about retaliation but defense. The campaign, Israeli officials say, is focused on degrading Gazan military infrastructure that is often built near homes and civilian institutions. Officials and analysts warn that a potential ground invasion of Gaza could be even bloodier than the air war. They argue that strikes that ease an Israeli ground advance will help reduce the loss of life for Palestinian civilians and Israeli soldiers alike, once the invasion begins.

Since Oct. 7, Israel has said it has targeted scores of Palestinian rocket launchers, command centers and munitions factories.

Israel’s military kept up its strikes on two fronts Monday, with an intense barrage on southern Lebanon and a retaliatory attack targeting Hamas in southern Gaza, a sign of how significantly the fighting has spread in the year since Hamas’s cross-border assault.

As Israelis commemorated the Oct. 7 attack that led to the war in the Gaza Strip, Hamas launched a rare rocket attack at Tel Aviv, saying it was targeting “the depths of the occupation.” The rocket strike did little damage, and hours later, Israel responded with what it said was an attack on the rocket launcher that had fired the projectiles.

Israel also sent more troops to Lebanon to support the ground invasion there that it began last week with the stated goal of stopping the militant group Hezbollah from firing rockets across the border.

And on a separate front, the military said it had intercepted a missile fired at Israel by the Houthi militia, which is based in Yemen, about 1,000 miles away.

The scope of that military activity against the groups — all of them backed by Iran — made clear how the fighting has broadened a year after Hamas led the attack on Israel. About 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage that day.

Patrick Kingsley reported from Jerusalem, Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv and Bilal Shbair from the Gaza Strip.

* Oct. 7, 2024

Yaniv Hegyi, an Israeli community organizer, fled his home last Oct. 7, after terrorists from Gaza overran his village in southern Israel. “I was sure that by January we would go back,” Mr. Hegyi said.

Mohammed Shakib Hassan, a Palestinian civil servant, fled his home on Oct. 12, after the Israeli Air Force responded by striking his city in northern Gaza. “We thought it would be two months — at most,” Mr. Hassan said.

Instead, the war in Gaza has dragged on for a year, with no end in sight.

It is the longest war between Israelis and Arabs since the end of the conflict that set the boundaries of the Israeli state in 1949. It is also by far the deadliest. More than 1,500 Israelis have been killed, mostly during Hamas’s attack on Oct. 7, and roughly 250 others were abducted. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s counterattack, which began with one of the most intense bombardments ever recorded in modern warfare.

A wider, multifront war between Israel and Hamas’s regional allies is now unfolding — most recently with Israel’s invasion of Lebanon and Iran’s bombardment of Israel — but the core of the conflict remains the original battle between Hamas and Israel, and the almost Sisyphean challenge of ending it.

When Britain’s foreign secretary declared last week that his government would recognize the state of Palestine if Israel did not agree to a cease-fire with Hamas, he said the British were doing so with the “hand of history on our shoulders.”

His French counterpart also invoked history in explaining why France had taken the same step a week earlier. French leaders going back to Charles de Gaulle, he said, had called for an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on “the recognition by each of the states involved of all the others.”

Neither man mentioned the Sykes-Picot Agreement, the secret treaty between Britain and France in 1916, under which the European colonial powers carved up the Levantine territories of the crumbling Ottoman Empire into spheres of British and French control. And why would they?

Sykes-Picot is cited by historians as an enduring example of Western imperial arrogance — a cynical exercise in drawing borders that cut across religious, ethnic and tribal communities in what are today Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian territories. To many Arabs, who view it as a great betrayal, it seeded a legacy of strife and bloodshed in the Middle East.

The real-time crisis unfolding in Gaza — the starving children, the Israeli restrictions on aid, the Palestinians killed as they try to collect food — undoubtedly had a greater impact on Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France than the stains of the past. Yet their momentous decisions have cast a light on the shadowy roles of both countries in a region where they once vied for influence.

Victims and relatives of people killed or injured in attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah have sued the United Nations agency dedicated to Palestinians, accusing it of aiding the armed groups and fueling terrorism.

The lawsuit was filed on Thursday in federal court in the District of Columbia by American citizens living in Israel and the United States and their family members. A similar case has been playing out since last year in federal court in Manhattan.

Both suits are attempting to hold the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, known as UNRWA, responsible in some measure for violent acts by Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, groups dedicated to the destruction of Israel that have been designated terrorist organizations by the United States. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages, both compensatory and punitive.

[Middle East](/section/world/middleeast)|A Weakened Hezbollah Resists Pressure to Give Up Its Weapons

Amid the tangled streets of Beirut’s southern reaches, mournful Hezbollah followers have turned the mausoleum of Hassan Nasrallah, the group’s leader for more than 30 years, into a pilgrimage site.

His grave, a white marble slab engraved with Quranic verses, is sheltered by a canopy adorned with white and yellow artificial flowers. Around it, men and women pray separately on a patchwork of carpets.

Mr. Nasrallah was assassinated in the fallout from the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which set off the war in Gaza. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah opened a second front in solidarity with Hamas by firing across the Lebanon-Israel border. The conflict eventually escalated into a full blown war, during which Israel eliminated Hezbollah’s leadership.

The Iran-backed group’s power has ebbed ever since, and after decades of building a formidable state within a state, Hezbollah faces an uncertain future.

“Hezbollah was two things: It was Hassan Nasrallah and the weapons,” said Mustafa Fahs, a Lebanese political commentator.

Now, at one of its weakest moments, Hezbollah finds itself struggling to hold on to the weapons that are at the very core of the group’s identity.

More than 60 migrants were killed when their overloaded boat capsized as they tried to cross the sea between the Horn of Africa and Yemen, the International Organization for Migration said on Sunday.

The boat trip across the Gulf of Aden is the first part of one of the most dangerous migration and smuggling routes in the world, which desperate men and women from Ethiopia and other East African countries traverse as they attempt to reach oil-rich Saudi Arabia.

The boat, believed to have been carrying 150 people, capsized on Saturday night near the southern Yemeni province of Abyan, Yemeni health and security officials said. The I.O.M. said in a statement said that 68 Ethiopian migrants had died. There were at least 12 survivors. An unknown number of passengers remain missing. The death toll is expected to rise as more bodies wash ashore, the local officials said.

The family of Evyatar David, an Israeli held hostage in Gaza, saw him for the first time in months on Friday evening in a video circulated by his Hamas captors. He was emaciated and sallow in what appeared to be an underground tunnel.

The video prompted an outpouring of fear and horror among the families of the dozens of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza nearly two years after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and ignited the war.

“Our brothers are turning into skin and bones at this very moment,” Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan was one of about 250 people taken hostage during the Hamas assault, said at a rally on Saturday. Her son is believed to still be alive.

More than 100 hostages were freed during two brief cease-fires, the last of which ended in March. Israeli forces have found the corpses of some other hostages as they have swept through Gaza. Israel believes that about 20 hostages are still alive and that nearly 30 are presumed dead.

Image!An emaciated man stands in a dark tunnel.

In a screenshot from a video circulated by Hamas, Evyatar David is seen emaciated and sallow in what appears to be an underground tunnel.

Cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas to free more hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners have stalled. Last month, Israeli and American negotiators left Doha, Qatar, where most of the talks have been held, without a breakthrough.

The Israeli government and President Trump’s Middle East envoy said on Thursday that they were recalling the teams that had been negotiating on a Gaza cease-fire with Hamas, perhaps imperiling the hope for the return of some of the last surviving Israeli hostages and relief for besieged Palestinians.

Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy, said in a statement that the latest response to an offer of a deal from Hamas’s surviving leadership showed “a lack of desire to reach a cease-fire in Gaza.” He added that “we will now consider alternative options to bring the hostages home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza,” without specifying what those alternatives might include.

But Israeli officials struck a different tone, saying the recall of the negotiators did not mean an end to the talks. In Jerusalem, three officials with knowledge of the negotiations said that there was no breakdown or collapse but that the delegation returned to discuss details ahead of further talks.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Wednesday that the military and security forces had recovered the remains of two Israeli hostages held in Gaza since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack that ignited the war.

“The bodies of two of our hostages were returned to Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement, adding that only one of their names, Yair Yaakov, had been cleared for publication.

Mr. Netanyahu said Mr. Yaakov had been “murdered and abducted” by the militant group Islamic Jihad in the 2023 attack. “Together with all citizens of Israel, my wife and I extend our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearest loved ones,” he added.

The Israeli military said in a statement on Wednesday about the other hostage: “His family has been notified and his name will be cleared for release later.”

Mr. Yaakov had been a member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a farming community near the border with Gaza that was hit hard by the assault. He was 59 when he was killed, according to a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of some captives.

He was taken from his home along with his children, Or and Yagil, and his partner, Meirav, according to the forum, and his death was confirmed in February 2024. The other family members were released as part of a temporary cease-fire deal in November 2023.

Atef Abu Khater, 17, who was healthy before Gaza was gripped by war, lies in intensive care in a hospital in the north of the Palestinian enclave, suffering from severe malnutrition.

“He is not responding to the treatment,” said his father, A’eed Abu Khater, 48, who has been sheltering in a tent in Gaza City with his wife and five children. “I feel helpless,” he added in a phone call, his voice strained with grief. “We lost our income in the war. Food is unaffordable. There is nothing.”

Gaza’s hospitals have struggled since early in the war to cope with the influx of Palestinians injured and maimed by Israeli airstrikes and, more recently, by shootings meant to disperse desperate crowds as they surge toward food convoys or head to aid distribution sites.

### What I Cover

Along with several Times colleagues in Jerusalem, I cover Israeli politics, society and culture. I also cover Palestinian affairs with a focus on the Palestinian minority in Israel. I am particularly interested in political, societal and generational change in Israel and how the various sectors of the population interconnect and compete for influence in a deeply divided country facing significant domestic and external challenges, and where there is no separation of religion and state. I write news stories, analysis pieces and more colorful features. To do so, I interact with officials and people from all walks of Israeli life, often traveling around the country. I also follow Israeli popular culture and enjoy writing stories about cultural events that stir internal debate.

### My Background

I joined The Times’s Jerusalem bureau in 2007 after 17 years as a journalist for other news outlets, primarily covering Palestinian affairs for The Jerusalem Report, an independent magazine. I have been based in Jerusalem for more than 30 years. I was born, raised and educated in England. I speak fluent Hebrew and working Arabic. Over the years I have covered wars, Palestinian uprisings and rounds of peace talks, multiple elections and the 2019 Eurovision contest in Tel Aviv. I have also covered Israeli movies, television and exhibits that have had an impact locally or have been of wider interest. I have written two books, most recently “The Land of Hope and Fear: Israel’s Battle for Its Inner Soul.”

### Journalistic Ethics

All Times journalists are committed to upholding the standards of integrity outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook. Covering the Israeli-Palestinian story comes with particular challenges, given the conflicting narratives going back many decades and the passionate, clashing agendas held by many of the people living this story and observing it. Aware that every word counts in such a charged environment, I always strive to be accurate, honest and fair. I try to take constructive criticism while blocking out superfluous noise. After so many years covering this story, I try to remain humble, to listen and to learn. There is always more to learn.

Most countries in the United Nations — 147 out of 193 — already recognize a Palestinian state, which currently has observer status at the U.N.

Then, in the course of just the past week, three more countries — all major U.S. allies — said they would join their ranks.

First, France said it would recognize a Palestinian state in September, and in the days that followed, Britain and Canada announced that they, too, were prepared to follow suit. Britain said it would move forward if Israel did not agree to a cease-fire with Hamas in Gaza by September, while Canada tied a final decision to political changes by the Palestinian Authority.

President Emmanuel Macron announced late Thursday that France would recognize the state of Palestine as part of “its historical commitment to a just and durable peace in the Middle East.”

In a surprise statement on X that followed months of hints and hesitations over possible French recognition of a Palestinian state, he said that he would make a formal announcement to that effect at the United Nations General Assembly in September in New York.

“Today the most urgent thing is that the war in Gaza cease and the civilian population be helped,” Mr. Macron said. His statement came as anger mounted across the world over the continued Israeli military operation in Gaza and growing starvation there.

France would become the first of the Group of 7 major industrialized nations — also including the United States, Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan and Italy — to recognize a Palestinian state. The decision appeared likely to irk the Trump administration as it stands behind Israel and pursues its own attempts to end the war in Gaza.

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, reacted angrily to the French move. He said in a statement that “we strongly condemn Mr. Macron’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state next to Tel Aviv in the wake of the Oct. 7 massacre” of 2023, adding that a Palestinian state could become “a launchpad to annihilate Israel.”

Israel has consistently opposed French recognition of Palestinian statehood, saying it would reward Hamas terrorism and accusing Mr. Macron of leading “a crusade against the Jewish state.” Relations between the two countries have become strained and now appear certain to worsen.

Diego Ibarra Sanchez reported from aboard a Jordanian Air Force C-130.

* Aug. 2, 2025

Airdrops are not known for their precision.

On Thursday, after sweeping over the devastated landscape that is now Gaza, a Jordanian Air Force plane descended and banked. Following a brief countdown, its rear doors opened and, with two crew members tethered at the edge, pallets of food were dispatched to an uncertain fate.

The method is notoriously unreliable, the amount of food insufficient, but Gazans are starving, and so after a hiatus of months, Jordan is one of several countries that have resumed the drops in recent days.

|  | `1` | `+ # Progressive Web Crawling with Adaptive Information Foraging` |
|  | `2` | `+` |
|  | `3` | `+ ## Abstract` |
|  | `4` | `+` |
|  | `5` | `+ This paper presents a novel approach to web crawling that adaptively determines when sufficient information has been gathered to answer a given query. Unlike traditional exhaustive crawling methods, our Progressive Information Sufficiency (PIS) framework uses statistical measures to balance information completeness against crawling efficiency. We introduce a multi-strategy architecture supporting pure statistical, embedding-enhanced, and LLM-assisted approaches, with theoretical guarantees on convergence and practical evaluation methods using synthetic datasets.` |
|  | `6` | `+` |
|  | `7` | `+ ## 1. Introduction` |
|  | `8` | `+` |
|  | `9` | `+ Traditional web crawling approaches follow predetermined patterns (breadth-first, depth-first) without consideration for information sufficiency. This work addresses the fundamental question: *"When do we have enough information to answer a query and similar queries in its domain?"*` |
|  | `10` | `+` |
|  | `11` | `+ We formalize this as an optimal stopping problem in information foraging, introducing metrics for coverage, consistency, and saturation that enable crawlers to make intelligent decisions about when to stop crawling and which links to follow.` |
|  | `12` | `+` |
|  | `13` | `+ ## 2. Problem Formulation` |
|  | `14` | `+` |
|  | `15` | `+ ### 2.1 Definitions` |
|  | `16` | `+` |
|  | `17` | `+ Let:` |
|  | `18` | `+ - **K** = {d₁, d₂, ..., dₙ} be the current knowledge base (crawled documents)` |
|  | `19` | `+ - **Q** be the user query` |
|  | `20` | `+ - **L** = {l₁, l₂, ..., lₘ} be available links with preview metadata` |
|  | `21` | `+ - **θ** be the confidence threshold for information sufficiency` |
|  | `22` | `+` |
|  | `23` | `+ ### 2.2 Objectives` |
|  | `24` | `+` |
|  | `25` | `+ 1. **Minimize** |K| (number of crawled pages)` |
|  | `26` | `+ 2. **Maximize** P(answers(Q) | K) (probability of answering Q given K)` |
|  | `27` | `+ 3. **Ensure** coverage of Q's domain (similar queries)` |
|  | `28` | `+` |
|  | `29` | `+ ## 3. Mathematical Framework` |
|  | `30` | `+` |
|  | `31` | `+ ### 3.1 Information Sufficiency Metric` |
|  | `32` | `+` |
|  | `33` | `+ We define Information Sufficiency as:` |
|  | `34` | `+` |
|  | `35` | `+ ```` |
|  | `36` | `+ IS(K, Q) = min(Coverage(K, Q), Consistency(K, Q), 1 - Redundancy(K)) × DomainCoverage(K, Q)` |
|  | `37` | `+ ```` |
|  | `38` | `+` |
|  | `39` | `+ ### 3.2 Coverage Score` |
|  | `40` | `+` |
|  | `41` | `+ Coverage measures how well current knowledge covers query terms and related concepts:` |
|  | `42` | `+` |
|  | `43` | `+ ```` |
|  | `44` | `+ Coverage(K, Q) = Σ(t ∈ Q) log(df(t, K) + 1) × idf(t) / |Q|` |
|  | `45` | `+ ```` |
|  | `46` | `+` |
|  | `47` | `+ Where:` |
|  | `48` | `+ - df(t, K) = document frequency of term t in knowledge base K` |
|  | `49` | `+ - idf(t) = inverse document frequency weight` |
|  | `50` | `+` |
|  | `51` | `+ ### 3.3 Consistency Score` |
|  | `52` | `+` |
|  | `53` | `+ Consistency measures information coherence across documents:` |
|  | `54` | `+` |
|  | `55` | `+ ```` |
|  | `56` | `+ Consistency(K, Q) = 1 - Var(answers from random subsets of K)` |
|  | `57` | `+ ```` |
|  | `58` | `+` |
|  | `59` | `+ This captures the principle that sufficient knowledge should provide stable answers regardless of document subset.` |
|  | `60` | `+` |
|  | `61` | `+ ### 3.4 Saturation Score` |
|  | `62` | `+` |
|  | `63` | `+ Saturation detects diminishing returns:` |
|  | `64` | `+` |
|  | `65` | `+ ```` |
|  | `66` | `+ Saturation(K) = 1 - (ΔInfo(Kₙ) / ΔInfo(K₁))` |
|  | `67` | `+ ```` |
|  | `68` | `+` |
|  | `69` | `+ Where ΔInfo represents marginal information gain from the nth crawl.` |
|  | `70` | `+` |
|  | `71` | `+ ### 3.5 Link Value Prediction` |
|  | `72` | `+` |
|  | `73` | `+ Expected information gain from uncrawled links:` |
|  | `74` | `+` |
|  | `75` | `+ ```` |
|  | `76` | `+ ExpectedGain(l) = Relevance(l, Q) × Novelty(l, K) × Authority(l)` |
|  | `77` | `+ ```` |
|  | `78` | `+` |
|  | `79` | `+ Components:` |
|  | `80` | `+ - **Relevance**: BM25(preview_text, Q)` |
|  | `81` | `+ - **Novelty**: 1 - max_similarity(preview, K)` |
|  | `82` | `+ - **Authority**: f(url_structure, domain_metrics)` |
|  | `83` | `+` |
|  | `84` | `+ ## 4. Algorithmic Approach` |
|  | `85` | `+` |
|  | `86` | `+ ### 4.1 Progressive Crawling Algorithm` |
|  | `87` | `+` |
|  | `88` | `+ ```` |
|  | `89` | `+ Algorithm: ProgressiveCrawl(start_url, query, θ)` |
|  | `90` | `+ K ← ∅` |
|  | `91` | `+ crawled ← {start_url}` |
|  | `92` | `+ pending ← extract_links(crawl(start_url))` |
|  | `93` | `+` |
|  | `94` | `+ while IS(K, Q) < θ and |crawled| < max_pages:` |
|  | `95` | `+ candidates ← rank_by_expected_gain(pending, Q, K)` |
|  | `96` | `+ if max(ExpectedGain(candidates)) < min_gain:` |
|  | `97` | `+ break // Diminishing returns` |
|  | `98` | `+` |
|  | `99` | `+ to_crawl ← top_k(candidates)` |
|  | `100` | `+ new_docs ← parallel_crawl(to_crawl)` |
|  | `101` | `+ K ← K ∪ new_docs` |
|  | `102` | `+ crawled ← crawled ∪ to_crawl` |
|  | `103` | `+ pending ← extract_new_links(new_docs) - crawled` |
|  | `104` | `+` |
|  | `105` | `+ return K` |
|  | `106` | `+ ```` |
|  | `107` | `+` |
|  | `108` | `+ ### 4.2 Stopping Criteria` |
|  | `109` | `+` |
|  | `110` | `+ Crawling terminates when:` |
|  | `111` | `+ 1. IS(K, Q) ≥ θ (sufficient information)` |
|  | `112` | `+ 2. d(IS)/d(crawls) < ε (plateau reached)` |
|  | `113` | `+ 3. |crawled| ≥ max_pages (resource limit)` |
|  | `114` | `+ 4. max(ExpectedGain) < min_gain (no promising links)` |
|  | `115` | `+` |
|  | `116` | `+ ## 5. Multi-Strategy Architecture` |
|  | `117` | `+` |
|  | `118` | `+ ### 5.1 Strategy Pattern Design` |
|  | `119` | `+` |
|  | `120` | `+ ```` |

|  | `122` | `+ ├── StatisticalStrategy (no LLM, no embeddings)` |
|  | `123` | `+ ├── EmbeddingStrategy (with semantic similarity)` |

|  | `137` | `+` |
|  | `138` | `+ ### 5.3 Embedding Strategy (Implemented)` |

|  | `143` | `+ - Gap-driven link selection` |
|  | `144` | `+ - Validation-based stopping criteria` |
|  | `145` | `+` |
|  | `146` | `+ **Mathematical Framework**:` |
|  | `147` | `+ ```` |
|  | `148` | `+ Coverage(K, Q) = mean(max_similarity(q, K) for q in Q_expanded)` |
|  | `149` | `+ Gap(q) = 1 - max_similarity(q, K)` |
|  | `150` | `+ LinkScore(l) = Σ(Gap(q) × relevance(l, q)) × (1 - redundancy(l, K))` |
|  | `151` | `+ ```` |
|  | `152` | `+` |
|  | `153` | `+ **Key Parameters**:` |
|  | `154` | `+ - `embedding_k_exp`: Exponential decay factor for distance-to-score mapping` |
|  | `155` | `+ - `embedding_coverage_radius`: Distance threshold for query coverage` |
|  | `156` | `+ - `embedding_min_confidence_threshold`: Minimum relevance threshold` |
|  | `157` | `+` |
|  | `158` | `+ **Advantages**: Semantic understanding, handles ambiguity, detects irrelevance` |
|  | `159` | `+ **Best for**: Research queries, conceptual topics, diverse content` |
|  | `160` | `+` |
|  | `161` | `+ ### 5.4 Progressive Enhancement Path` |
|  | `162` | `+` |
|  | `163` | `+ 1. **Level 0**: Statistical only (implemented)` |
|  | `164` | `+ 2. **Level 1**: + Embeddings for semantic similarity (implemented)` |
|  | `165` | `+ 3. **Level 2**: + LLM for query understanding (future)` |
|  | `166` | `+` |
|  | `167` | `+ ## 6. Evaluation Methodology` |
|  | `168` | `+` |
|  | `169` | `+ ### 6.1 Synthetic Dataset Generation` |
|  | `170` | `+` |
|  | `171` | `+ Using LLM to create evaluation data:` |
|  | `172` | `+` |
|  | `173` | `+ ```python` |
|  | `174` | `+ def generate_synthetic_dataset(domain_url):` |
|  | `175` | `+ # 1. Fully crawl domain` |
|  | `176` | `+ full_knowledge = exhaustive_crawl(domain_url)` |
|  | `177` | `+` |
|  | `178` | `+ # 2. Generate answerable queries` |
|  | `179` | `+ queries = llm_generate_queries(full_knowledge)` |
|  | `180` | `+` |
|  | `181` | `+ # 3. Create query variations` |
|  | `182` | `+ for q in queries:` |
|  | `183` | `+ variations = generate_variations(q) # synonyms, sub/super queries` |
|  | `184` | `+` |
|  | `185` | `+ return queries, variations, full_knowledge` |
|  | `186` | `+ ```` |
|  | `187` | `+` |
|  | `188` | `+ ### 6.2 Evaluation Metrics` |
|  | `189` | `+` |
|  | `190` | `+ 1. **Efficiency**: Information gained / Pages crawled` |

|  | `205` | `+ **Theorem**: For finite websites, ProgressiveCrawl converges to IS(K, Q) ≥ θ or exhausts all reachable pages.` |
|  | `206` | `+` |
|  | `207` | `+ **Proof sketch**: IS(K, Q) is monotonically non-decreasing with each crawl, bounded above by 1.` |
|  | `208` | `+` |
|  | `209` | `+ ### 7.2 Optimality` |
|  | `210` | `+` |
|  | `211` | `+ Under certain assumptions about link preview accuracy:` |
|  | `212` | `+ - Expected crawls ≤ 2 × optimal_crawls` |

|  | `236` | `+` |
|  | `237` | `+ ## 9. Future Directions` |
|  | `238` | `+` |
|  | `239` | `+ ### 9.1 Advanced Scoring` |
|  | `240` | `+` |
|  | `241` | `+ - Temporal information value` |
|  | `242` | `+ - Multi-query optimization` |

|  | `246` | `+` |
|  | `247` | `+ - Collaborative knowledge building` |

|  | `252` | `+ - Transfer learning across domains` |
|  | `253` | `+ - Meta-learning for threshold selection` |
|  | `254` | `+` |
|  | `255` | `+ ## 10. Conclusion` |
|  | `256` | `+` |
|  | `257` | `+ Progressive crawling with adaptive information foraging provides a principled approach to efficient web information extraction. By combining coverage, consistency, and saturation metrics, we can determine information sufficiency without ground truth labels. The multi-strategy architecture allows graceful enhancement from pure statistical to LLM-assisted approaches based on requirements and resources.` |

You are an expert assistant. Using only the current webpage content below, answer the user's question by quoting the relevant passage, code block, or table WORD-FOR-WORD, including ALL formatting, indentation, and line breaks. DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or shorten ANY part of the quoted answer, unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize giving the most detailed answer possible by quoting the all relevant text from the content. If the content has numbers, prices, code, tables, or other specific details, quote them exactly as they appear. If multiple relevant passages are found, include ALL of them in their entirety, word-for-word. ALWAYS provide which page they should visit to find the exact information they are looking for, if possible, by saying 'Please visit [page URL] for the full details.' If you cite information from a source, always include the full URL shown in the source.If no answer is found, summarize anything related, and politely inform the user that the answer does not appear to be present, suggest a related page by URL if present in the content. Do not hallucinate.At the end, write 'SUFFICIENT: YES' if the answer fully resolves the question, or 'SUFFICIENT: NO' if not. Write 'CONFIDENCE: <0-100>%'

class AsyncWebCrawler:
    """
    Asynchronous web crawler with flexible caching capabilities.
    There are two ways to use the crawler:
    1. Using context manager (recommended for simple cases):
        ```python
        async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
            result = await crawler.arun(url="
        ```
    2. Using explicit lifecycle management (recommended for long-running applications):
        ```python
        crawler = AsyncWebCrawler()
        await crawler.start()
        # Use the crawler multiple times
        result1 = await crawler.arun(url="
        result2 = await crawler.arun(url="
        await crawler.close()
        ```
    Attributes:
        browser_config (BrowserConfig): Configuration object for browser settings.
        crawler_strategy (AsyncCrawlerStrategy): Strategy for crawling web pages.
        logger (AsyncLogger): Logger instance for recording events and errors.
        crawl4ai_folder (str): Directory for storing cache.
        base_directory (str): Base directory for storing cache.
        ready (bool): Whether the crawler is ready for use.
    Methods:
        start(): Start the crawler explicitly without using context manager.
        close(): Close the crawler explicitly without using context manager.
        arun(): Run the crawler for a single source: URL (web, local file, or raw HTML).
        awarmup(): Perform warmup sequence.
        arun_many(): Run the crawler for multiple sources.
        aprocess_html(): Process HTML content.
    Typical Usage:
        async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
            result = await crawler.arun(url="
            print(result.markdown)
        Using configuration:
        browser_config = BrowserConfig(browser_type="chromium", headless=True)
        async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
            crawler_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
                cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
            )
            result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=crawler_config)
            print(result.markdown)

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Mobile
Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Select Video effects.

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed.

Select Preview to view the background before you apply it.

Select Apply.

Notes: 

Linux users aren't able to use this feature.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

### Start a live transcription

When you [record a meeting](/en-us/office/record-a-meeting-in-microsoft-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24), transcription starts automatically.

To start a live transcription only:

1. Select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c) in your meeting controls.
2. Select **Record and transcribe**  ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e) > **Start transcription**  ![Start transcription icon in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/50689f70-1f91-43ea-aa68-dfa88cb7476c).
3. Confirm the language everyone is speaking in the meeting.
4. Select **Confirm**.

​​​​​​​All participants see a notification that the meeting is being transcribed. Participants can choose to [hide their identities in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).

Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### Change transcription language

To ensure transcription accuracy, make sure the meeting spoken language reflects the language everyone is speaking.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To change the transcription language:

1. Select **More actions**  ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c) in your meeting controls.
2. Hover over **Record and transcribe**  ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
3. Select **Show transcript**  ![Start transcription icon in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/50689f70-1f91-43ea-aa68-dfa88cb7476c).
4. In the transcript pane, select **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff)​​​​​​​.
5. In **Meeting spoken language**, select the language people are speaking.
6. Select **Update**. The transcript will now display in this language.

**Important:**For other participants to access the meeting spoken language, transcription must be turned off. If there’s an ongoing transcription, they must first turn it off or turn off the feature that started the transcription. Then, they must manually turn transcription on again.

* No one

For info about organizer and presenter roles, see [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

| Type of meeting participant | Start and stop transcription | View real-time transcription | View transcript after meeting | Download transcript after meeting |

| Person from same organization | Yes | Yes | Yes | No, but organizers can configure who can download on Stream. |
| Person from another tenant | No | Yes | No | No |
| Anonymous | No | No | No | No |

People who call into a meeting can't view the transcript.

**Notes:**

* Teams live transcripts for meetings with recording and/or transcription are stored in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business. The transcript can be accessed through the meeting chat and **Recap** tab in Teams until a meeting organizer deletes the transcript.
* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

* No one

For info about organizer and presenter roles, see [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

**Notes:**

* Teams live transcripts for meetings with recording and/or transcription are stored in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business. The transcript can be accessed through the meeting chat and **Recap** tab in Teams until a meeting organizer deletes the transcript.
* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

CONTENT:
Communicate clearly and efficiently during multilingual meetings and conferences with language interpretation in Microsoft Teams.

Language interpretation allows professional interpreters to convert what the speaker says into another language in real-time, without disrupting the speaker's original flow of delivery. This simultaneous interpretation will lead to more inclusive meetings, where participants who speak different languages can fully collaborate with each other.

**Notes:**

* Language interpretation is not currently available in [end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings](/en-us/office/use-end-to-end-encryption-for-teams-meetings-a8326d15-d187-49c4-ac99-14c17dbd617c).
* If you turn on [spatial audio](/en-us/office/spatial-audio-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-547b5f81-1825-4ee1-a1cf-f02e12db4fdb) in a meeting with live interpretation, you'll hear the original and translated audio at the same volume. Turn off spatial audio and rejoin the meeting to hear the interpreter's voice clearly with reduced original voice.

## Interpreter experience

Interpreters can hear all speakers and start interpreting immediately after they join a meeting. Once they join, they won't be able to switch rooms themselves.

Interpreters can also switch their translation direction during a Teams meeting by selecting the language they’re currently translating into at the bottom of the meeting window. The language they’re translating into will appear highlighted.

![Screenshot highlighting the interpreter experience in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/51b272e5-69de-4256-b60f-3b905aa99ff1)

## FAQ

### Does Microsoft provide interpreters?

Microsoft does not provide interpreters. Organizations will need to hire their own interpreters to support their interpretation needs.

### Can interpreters join on web?

Language interpretation isn't currently supported for interpreters or attendees joining on Teams for web.

### What information does the interpreter have access to?

Interpreters will have the same permissions as attendees. They'll be able to see the meeting chat, meeting roster, etc.

### How many interpreters can I add to a meeting?

You can add up to 16 different language pairs (for example, translating French to Spanish counts as one language pair). You can assign as many interpreters to the 16 language pairs as needed.

Note: An interpreter can't be an organizer or co-organizer of the meeting.

### What types of meetings does this feature work with?

Language interpretation is supported for regular scheduled meetings, channel meetings, meetings with up to 1000 participants, and webinars.

Breakout rooms are not currently supported. In meetings with breakout rooms, the main meeting can be interpreted, but interpretation will stop when the breakout rooms start.

Language interpretation is not currently available in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings.

### Can I turn on captions for a meeting with interpretation?

Captions in a meeting with language interpretation will only caption the main speaker, not the interpreter. If the language of the main speaker changes, the meeting's organizer will need to switch the live captions' spoken language to the correct language for captioning to work.

### Will meeting recordings have both original and translated audio?

Meeting recordings in a meeting with language interpretation only capture the audio of the main channel, or original speaker. The interpreter's audio will not be present on the recording.

Compliance recording is not currently supported in meetings with language interpretation.

### What kind of set up do interpreters need?

Interpreters must join meetings on Teams for desktop. Language selection isn't available on Teams for web or mobile.

[Set up live translated captions](#setuptranslatedcaptions)

## Live c​​​​​​​aptions in Teams

Teams can detect what’s said in a meeting and present real-time captions. If you're using the desktop app for Windows or Mac, there are also several caption customization options.

**Notes:**

* People can choose not to be identified in captions. For details, see [Hide your identity in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).
* Teams doesn't save captions. If you'd like a transcript of the meeting, turn on transcription. You'll be able to download the transcript after the meeting.

There are a couple ways to get live captions in Teams:

* From the built-in captioning provided by Teams
* From a Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART) captioner. To learn how to use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting, refer to [Use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting (human generated captions)](/en-us/office/use-cart-captions-in-a-microsoft-teams-meeting-human-generated-captions-2dd889e8-32a8-4582-98b8-6c96cf14eb47).

## Live caption settings

Teams has built-in closed captioning you can turn on from the meeting controls.

### Turn captions on and off

* To use live captions in a meeting, go to your meeting controls at the top of the screen and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Show live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).
* To stop using live captions, go to your meeting controls and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Hide live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).

### Change the spoken language

Set a meeting’s spoken language to the language people are speaking for more accurate captions.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To access the meeting spoken language settings:

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
2. In the **Meeting spoken language** dropdown menu, select the language everyone is speaking from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Update** to change.

**Important:**For other participants to access the meeting spoken language, transcription must be turned off. If there’s an ongoing transcription, they must first turn it off or turn off the feature that started the transcription. Then, they must manually turn transcription on again.

## Set up live translated captions in an event

In town halls and live events, organizers preselect which languages attendees can see live captions in. Organizers can select six languages, or ten if they have Premium, from over 50 different languages.

### To set up live translated captions in an event:

1. Open the event in your Teams calendar.
2. In **Details**, select **Meeting options** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e).
3. In **Engagement**​​​​​​​  ![Teams Chat Tab icon](/images/en-us/3c2a24f3-7e8f-4419-8c78-16c5a795d45f) > **Translate attendee captions**, select the languages that live translated captions will be available in during your event.  
     
   ![Meeting option showing how to add languages for live translated captions in an event.](/images/en-us/7249ee23-9636-4844-b2a0-f0dae56359f7)
4. Select **Apply**.

Attendees can see live translated captions in only one of the languages you preselected.

## Use live translated captions

By default, live captions are shown in the language used during the meeting or event. Live translated captions allow users to see captions translated into the language they’re most comfortable with.

**Note:**Live translated captions in meetings are only available as part of Teams Premium, an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to Teams Premium, contact your IT admin.

### To use live translated captions:

1. Turn on live captions in your meeting.
2. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
3. Make sure **Meeting spoken language** is correct.
4. Turn on the **Translate to** toggle.
5. In the dropdown menu, select the language you want your captions translated to.

### Customize captions

If you're using the desktop app on Windows or Mac, you can customize the font size and color, increase the number of lines displayed, and change the positioning of the captions in the meeting window.

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Caption styles** ![Color icon in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/8fdf1401-2b5e-4511-81a1-83c9e4e2f20f).
2. Choose the color, position, and style you want to see your captions in.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### Get the most out of your captions

To make sure your live captions are as accurate as possible, try these best practices:

* Speak clearly, slowly, and directly into the mic. As your distance from the mic increases, captions may become less accurate.
* Avoid locations with background noise.
* Avoid having multiple people speak at the same time.
* Use the highest-quality Teams-certified equipment available to you.

**Note:**Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### FAQ

#### Where does Teams process the data it uses to provide live captions?

We process the data in the geographical region where your organization is based.

#### What data does Teams use to create the captions?

The Microsoft Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology service, which generates Teams meeting captions, may use a meeting's subject, invitation, participant names, attachments, and recent emails of the participants to improve the accuracy of captions.

#### How does Teams translate live captions?

We use the Microsoft Speech Translation technology powered by Azure Cognitive Services for translating live captions.

#### Who has access to this data?

No one. Microsoft ASR involves no human intervention, and no one can access the meeting audio or any other meeting information at any time.

#### Does Teams store any caption data?

No. Caption data is permanently deleted after the meeting is over.

#### If I don't want Teams to process this data to begin with, can I prevent it?

Yes. Simply don't turn on live captions. Your admin can also disable the feature altogether. Go herefor more info about how to do that.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

Teams can detect what's said in a meeting or group call and present real-time captions.

**Note:**Captions aren't yet available in government clouds on the Teams mobile app.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Desktop
Mobile
Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Select Video effects.

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

Select Apply.

Notes: 

Linux users aren't able to use this feature.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

CONTENT:
Communicate clearly and efficiently during multilingual meetings and conferences with language interpretation in Microsoft Teams.

Language interpretation allows professional interpreters to convert what the speaker says into another language in real-time, without disrupting the speaker's original flow of delivery. This simultaneous interpretation will lead to more inclusive meetings, where participants who speak different languages can fully collaborate with each other.

## Interpreter experience

Interpreters can hear all speakers and start interpreting immediately after they join a meeting. Once they join, they won't be able to switch rooms themselves.

Interpreters can also switch their translation direction during a Teams meeting by selecting the language they’re currently translating into at the bottom of the meeting window. The language they’re translating into will appear highlighted.

## FAQ

### Does Microsoft provide interpreters?

Microsoft does not provide interpreters. Organizations will need to hire their own interpreters to support their interpretation needs.

### Can interpreters join on web?

Language interpretation isn't currently supported for interpreters or attendees joining on Teams for web.

### What information does the interpreter have access to?

Interpreters will have the same permissions as attendees. They'll be able to see the meeting chat, meeting roster, etc.

### How many interpreters can I add to a meeting?

You can add up to 16 different language pairs (for example, translating French to Spanish counts as one language pair). You can assign as many interpreters to the 16 language pairs as needed.

Note: An interpreter can't be an organizer or co-organizer of the meeting.

### What types of meetings does this feature work with?

Language interpretation is supported for regular scheduled meetings, channel meetings, meetings with up to 1000 participants, and webinars.

Breakout rooms are not currently supported. In meetings with breakout rooms, the main meeting can be interpreted, but interpretation will stop when the breakout rooms start.

Language interpretation is not currently available in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings.

### Can I turn on captions for a meeting with interpretation?

Captions in a meeting with language interpretation will only caption the main speaker, not the interpreter. If the language of the main speaker changes, the meeting's organizer will need to switch the live captions' spoken language to the correct language for captioning to work.

### Will meeting recordings have both original and translated audio?

Meeting recordings in a meeting with language interpretation only capture the audio of the main channel, or original speaker. The interpreter's audio will not be present on the recording.

Compliance recording is not currently supported in meetings with language interpretation.

### What kind of set up do interpreters need?

Interpreters must join meetings on Teams for desktop. Language selection isn't available on Teams for web or mobile.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

With Teams Premium and Copilot, meeting organizers can manage recording and transcribing permissions when they schedule Teams meetings.

There are three options for who can record and transcribe a meeting:

* Organizers and co-organizers
* Organizers, co-organizers and presenters
* No one

For info about organizer and presenter roles, see [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

| Type of meeting participant | Start and stop transcription | View real-time transcription | View transcript after meeting | Download transcript after meeting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Organizer | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Person from same organization | Yes | Yes | Yes | No, but organizers can configure who can download on Stream. |
| Person from another tenant | No | Yes | No | No |
| Anonymous | No | No | No | No |

People who call into a meeting can't view the transcript.

**Notes:**

* Teams live transcripts for meetings with recording and/or transcription are stored in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business. The transcript can be accessed through the meeting chat and **Recap** tab in Teams until a meeting organizer deletes the transcript.
* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

During a Teams meeting, you can start a live transcription that captures everything being said. The text appears alongside the meeting video or audio in real time, including the speaker's name and time stamp.

### Start a live transcription

When you [record a meeting](/en-us/office/record-a-meeting-in-microsoft-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24), transcription starts automatically.

Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### Change transcription language

To ensure transcription accuracy, make sure the meeting spoken language reflects the language everyone is speaking.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

* No one

For info about organizer and presenter roles, see [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

| Person from another tenant | No | Yes | No | No |
| Anonymous | No | No | No | No |

People who call into a meeting can't view the transcript.

**Notes:**

* Teams live transcripts for meetings with recording and/or transcription are stored in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business. The transcript can be accessed through the meeting chat and **Recap** tab in Teams until a meeting organizer deletes the transcript.
* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

CONTENT:
Communicate clearly and efficiently during multilingual meetings and conferences with language interpretation in Microsoft Teams.

Language interpretation allows professional interpreters to convert what the speaker says into another language in real-time, without disrupting the speaker's original flow of delivery. This simultaneous interpretation will lead to more inclusive meetings, where participants who speak different languages can fully collaborate with each other.

**Notes:**

* Language interpretation is not currently available in [end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings](/en-us/office/use-end-to-end-encryption-for-teams-meetings-a8326d15-d187-49c4-ac99-14c17dbd617c).
* If you turn on [spatial audio](/en-us/office/spatial-audio-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-547b5f81-1825-4ee1-a1cf-f02e12db4fdb) in a meeting with live interpretation, you'll hear the original and translated audio at the same volume. Turn off spatial audio and rejoin the meeting to hear the interpreter's voice clearly with reduced original voice.

## Interpreter experience

Interpreters can hear all speakers and start interpreting immediately after they join a meeting. Once they join, they won't be able to switch rooms themselves.

Interpreters can also switch their translation direction during a Teams meeting by selecting the language they’re currently translating into at the bottom of the meeting window. The language they’re translating into will appear highlighted.

## FAQ

### Does Microsoft provide interpreters?

Microsoft does not provide interpreters. Organizations will need to hire their own interpreters to support their interpretation needs.

### Can interpreters join on web?

Language interpretation isn't currently supported for interpreters or attendees joining on Teams for web.

### What information does the interpreter have access to?

Interpreters will have the same permissions as attendees. They'll be able to see the meeting chat, meeting roster, etc.

### How many interpreters can I add to a meeting?

You can add up to 16 different language pairs (for example, translating French to Spanish counts as one language pair). You can assign as many interpreters to the 16 language pairs as needed.

Note: An interpreter can't be an organizer or co-organizer of the meeting.

### What types of meetings does this feature work with?

Language interpretation is supported for regular scheduled meetings, channel meetings, meetings with up to 1000 participants, and webinars.

Breakout rooms are not currently supported. In meetings with breakout rooms, the main meeting can be interpreted, but interpretation will stop when the breakout rooms start.

Language interpretation is not currently available in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings.

### Can I turn on captions for a meeting with interpretation?

Captions in a meeting with language interpretation will only caption the main speaker, not the interpreter. If the language of the main speaker changes, the meeting's organizer will need to switch the live captions' spoken language to the correct language for captioning to work.

### Will meeting recordings have both original and translated audio?

Meeting recordings in a meeting with language interpretation only capture the audio of the main channel, or original speaker. The interpreter's audio will not be present on the recording.

Compliance recording is not currently supported in meetings with language interpretation.

### What kind of set up do interpreters need?

Interpreters must join meetings on Teams for desktop. Language selection isn't available on Teams for web or mobile.

### Start a live transcription

When you [record a meeting](/en-us/office/record-a-meeting-in-microsoft-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24), transcription starts automatically.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.

| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |

   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

## Live c​​​​​​​aptions in Teams

Teams can detect what’s said in a meeting and present real-time captions. If you're using the desktop app for Windows or Mac, there are also several caption customization options.

**Notes:**

* People can choose not to be identified in captions. For details, see [Hide your identity in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).
* Teams doesn't save captions. If you'd like a transcript of the meeting, turn on transcription. You'll be able to download the transcript after the meeting.

There are a couple ways to get live captions in Teams:

* From the built-in captioning provided by Teams
* From a Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART) captioner. To learn how to use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting, refer to [Use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting (human generated captions)](/en-us/office/use-cart-captions-in-a-microsoft-teams-meeting-human-generated-captions-2dd889e8-32a8-4582-98b8-6c96cf14eb47).

## Live caption settings

Teams has built-in closed captioning you can turn on from the meeting controls.

### Change the spoken language

Set a meeting’s spoken language to the language people are speaking for more accurate captions.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To access the meeting spoken language settings:

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
2. In the **Meeting spoken language** dropdown menu, select the language everyone is speaking from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Update** to change.

**Important:**For other participants to access the meeting spoken language, transcription must be turned off. If there’s an ongoing transcription, they must first turn it off or turn off the feature that started the transcription. Then, they must manually turn transcription on again.

## Set up live translated captions in an event

### Get the most out of your captions

To make sure your live captions are as accurate as possible, try these best practices:

* Speak clearly, slowly, and directly into the mic. As your distance from the mic increases, captions may become less accurate.
* Avoid locations with background noise.
* Avoid having multiple people speak at the same time.
* Use the highest-quality Teams-certified equipment available to you.

**Note:**Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### FAQ

#### Where does Teams process the data it uses to provide live captions?

We process the data in the geographical region where your organization is based.

#### What data does Teams use to create the captions?

The Microsoft Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology service, which generates Teams meeting captions, may use a meeting's subject, invitation, participant names, attachments, and recent emails of the participants to improve the accuracy of captions.

#### How does Teams translate live captions?

We use the Microsoft Speech Translation technology powered by Azure Cognitive Services for translating live captions.

#### Who has access to this data?

No one. Microsoft ASR involves no human intervention, and no one can access the meeting audio or any other meeting information at any time.

#### Does Teams store any caption data?

No. Caption data is permanently deleted after the meeting is over.

#### If I don't want Teams to process this data to begin with, can I prevent it?

Yes. Simply don't turn on live captions. Your admin can also disable the feature altogether. Go herefor more info about how to do that.

CONTENT:
Communicate clearly and efficiently during multilingual meetings and conferences with language interpretation in Microsoft Teams.

Language interpretation allows professional interpreters to convert what the speaker says into another language in real-time, without disrupting the speaker's original flow of delivery. This simultaneous interpretation will lead to more inclusive meetings, where participants who speak different languages can fully collaborate with each other.

**Notes:**

* Language interpretation is not currently available in [end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings](/en-us/office/use-end-to-end-encryption-for-teams-meetings-a8326d15-d187-49c4-ac99-14c17dbd617c).

Turn off spatial audio and rejoin the meeting to hear the interpreter's voice clearly with reduced original voice.

## Interpreter experience

Interpreters can hear all speakers and start interpreting immediately after they join a meeting. Once they join, they won't be able to switch rooms themselves.

Interpreters can also switch their translation direction during a Teams meeting by selecting the language they’re currently translating into at the bottom of the meeting window. The language they’re translating into will appear highlighted.

![Screenshot highlighting the interpreter experience in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/51b272e5-69de-4256-b60f-3b905aa99ff1)

## FAQ

### Does Microsoft provide interpreters?

Microsoft does not provide interpreters. Organizations will need to hire their own interpreters to support their interpretation needs.

### Can interpreters join on web?

Language interpretation isn't currently supported for interpreters or attendees joining on Teams for web.

### What information does the interpreter have access to?

Interpreters will have the same permissions as attendees. They'll be able to see the meeting chat, meeting roster, etc.

### How many interpreters can I add to a meeting?

You can add up to 16 different language pairs (for example, translating French to Spanish counts as one language pair). You can assign as many interpreters to the 16 language pairs as needed.

Note: An interpreter can't be an organizer or co-organizer of the meeting.

### What types of meetings does this feature work with?

Language interpretation is supported for regular scheduled meetings, channel meetings, meetings with up to 1000 participants, and webinars.

Breakout rooms are not currently supported. In meetings with breakout rooms, the main meeting can be interpreted, but interpretation will stop when the breakout rooms start.

Language interpretation is not currently available in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings.

### Can I turn on captions for a meeting with interpretation?

Captions in a meeting with language interpretation will only caption the main speaker, not the interpreter. If the language of the main speaker changes, the meeting's organizer will need to switch the live captions' spoken language to the correct language for captioning to work.

### Will meeting recordings have both original and translated audio?

Meeting recordings in a meeting with language interpretation only capture the audio of the main channel, or original speaker. The interpreter's audio will not be present on the recording.

Compliance recording is not currently supported in meetings with language interpretation.

### What kind of set up do interpreters need?

Interpreters must join meetings on Teams for desktop. Language selection isn't available on Teams for web or mobile.

CONTENT:
Communicate clearly and efficiently during multilingual meetings and conferences with language interpretation in Microsoft Teams.

Language interpretation allows professional interpreters to convert what the speaker says into another language in real-time, without disrupting the speaker's original flow of delivery. This simultaneous interpretation will lead to more inclusive meetings, where participants who speak different languages can fully collaborate with each other.

**Notes:**

* Language interpretation is not currently available in [end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings](/en-us/office/use-end-to-end-encryption-for-teams-meetings-a8326d15-d187-49c4-ac99-14c17dbd617c).
* If you turn on [spatial audio](/en-us/office/spatial-audio-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-547b5f81-1825-4ee1-a1cf-f02e12db4fdb) in a meeting with live interpretation, you'll hear the original and translated audio at the same volume. Turn off spatial audio and rejoin the meeting to hear the interpreter's voice clearly with reduced original voice.

## Interpreter experience

Interpreters can hear all speakers and start interpreting immediately after they join a meeting. Once they join, they won't be able to switch rooms themselves.

Interpreters can also switch their translation direction during a Teams meeting by selecting the language they’re currently translating into at the bottom of the meeting window. The language they’re translating into will appear highlighted.

## FAQ

### Does Microsoft provide interpreters?

Microsoft does not provide interpreters. Organizations will need to hire their own interpreters to support their interpretation needs.

### Can interpreters join on web?

Language interpretation isn't currently supported for interpreters or attendees joining on Teams for web.

### What information does the interpreter have access to?

Interpreters will have the same permissions as attendees. They'll be able to see the meeting chat, meeting roster, etc.

### How many interpreters can I add to a meeting?

You can add up to 16 different language pairs (for example, translating French to Spanish counts as one language pair). You can assign as many interpreters to the 16 language pairs as needed.

Note: An interpreter can't be an organizer or co-organizer of the meeting.

### What types of meetings does this feature work with?

Language interpretation is supported for regular scheduled meetings, channel meetings, meetings with up to 1000 participants, and webinars.

Breakout rooms are not currently supported. In meetings with breakout rooms, the main meeting can be interpreted, but interpretation will stop when the breakout rooms start.

Language interpretation is not currently available in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings.

### Can I turn on captions for a meeting with interpretation?

Captions in a meeting with language interpretation will only caption the main speaker, not the interpreter. If the language of the main speaker changes, the meeting's organizer will need to switch the live captions' spoken language to the correct language for captioning to work.

### Will meeting recordings have both original and translated audio?

Meeting recordings in a meeting with language interpretation only capture the audio of the main channel, or original speaker. The interpreter's audio will not be present on the recording.

Compliance recording is not currently supported in meetings with language interpretation.

### What kind of set up do interpreters need?

Interpreters must join meetings on Teams for desktop. Language selection isn't available on Teams for web or mobile.

## FAQ

### Why is my meeting recording automatically if I didn’t schedule it that way?

**Notes:**

* To use this feature, the event must be at least transcribed. For the best recap experience, record and transcribe the event.
* AI summaries might look different based on the event's transcription language. This is due to differences in AI language models. We're continuing to improve these features.

## Live c​​​​​​​aptions in Teams

Teams can detect what’s said in a meeting and present real-time captions. If you're using the desktop app for Windows or Mac, there are also several caption customization options.

**Notes:**

* People can choose not to be identified in captions. For details, see [Hide your identity in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).
* Teams doesn't save captions. If you'd like a transcript of the meeting, turn on transcription. You'll be able to download the transcript after the meeting.

There are a couple ways to get live captions in Teams:

* From the built-in captioning provided by Teams
* From a Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART) captioner. To learn how to use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting, refer to [Use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting (human generated captions)](/en-us/office/use-cart-captions-in-a-microsoft-teams-meeting-human-generated-captions-2dd889e8-32a8-4582-98b8-6c96cf14eb47).

## Live caption settings

Teams has built-in closed captioning you can turn on from the meeting controls.

### Turn captions on and off

* To use live captions in a meeting, go to your meeting controls at the top of the screen and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Show live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).
* To stop using live captions, go to your meeting controls and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Hide live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).

### Change the spoken language

Set a meeting’s spoken language to the language people are speaking for more accurate captions.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To access the meeting spoken language settings:

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
2. In the **Meeting spoken language** dropdown menu, select the language everyone is speaking from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Update** to change.

**Important:**For other participants to access the meeting spoken language, transcription must be turned off. If there’s an ongoing transcription, they must first turn it off or turn off the feature that started the transcription. Then, they must manually turn transcription on again.

## Set up live translated captions in an event

In town halls and live events, organizers preselect which languages attendees can see live captions in. Organizers can select six languages, or ten if they have Premium, from over 50 different languages.

### To set up live translated captions in an event:

1. Open the event in your Teams calendar.
2. In **Details**, select **Meeting options** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e).
3. In **Engagement**​​​​​​​  ![Teams Chat Tab icon](/images/en-us/3c2a24f3-7e8f-4419-8c78-16c5a795d45f) > **Translate attendee captions**, select the languages that live translated captions will be available in during your event.  
     
   ![Meeting option showing how to add languages for live translated captions in an event.](/images/en-us/7249ee23-9636-4844-b2a0-f0dae56359f7)
4. Select **Apply**.

Attendees can see live translated captions in only one of the languages you preselected.

## Use live translated captions

By default, live captions are shown in the language used during the meeting or event. Live translated captions allow users to see captions translated into the language they’re most comfortable with.

**Note:**Live translated captions in meetings are only available as part of Teams Premium, an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to Teams Premium, contact your IT admin.

### To use live translated captions:

1. Turn on live captions in your meeting.
2. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
3. Make sure **Meeting spoken language** is correct.
4. Turn on the **Translate to** toggle.
5. In the dropdown menu, select the language you want your captions translated to.

### Customize captions

If you're using the desktop app on Windows or Mac, you can customize the font size and color, increase the number of lines displayed, and change the positioning of the captions in the meeting window.

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Caption styles** ![Color icon in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/8fdf1401-2b5e-4511-81a1-83c9e4e2f20f).
2. Choose the color, position, and style you want to see your captions in.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### Get the most out of your captions

To make sure your live captions are as accurate as possible, try these best practices:

* Speak clearly, slowly, and directly into the mic. As your distance from the mic increases, captions may become less accurate.
* Avoid locations with background noise.
* Avoid having multiple people speak at the same time.
* Use the highest-quality Teams-certified equipment available to you.

**Note:**Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### FAQ

#### Where does Teams process the data it uses to provide live captions?

We process the data in the geographical region where your organization is based.

#### What data does Teams use to create the captions?

The Microsoft Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology service, which generates Teams meeting captions, may use a meeting's subject, invitation, participant names, attachments, and recent emails of the participants to improve the accuracy of captions.

#### How does Teams translate live captions?

We use the Microsoft Speech Translation technology powered by Azure Cognitive Services for translating live captions.

#### Who has access to this data?

No one. Microsoft ASR involves no human intervention, and no one can access the meeting audio or any other meeting information at any time.

#### Does Teams store any caption data?

No. Caption data is permanently deleted after the meeting is over.

#### If I don't want Teams to process this data to begin with, can I prevent it?

Yes. Simply don't turn on live captions. Your admin can also disable the feature altogether. Go herefor more info about how to do that.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

Teams can detect what's said in a meeting or group call and present real-time captions.

**Note:**Captions aren't yet available in government clouds on the Teams mobile app.

### Change the spoken language

Set a meeting’s spoken language to the language people are speaking for more accurate captions.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

2. In the **Meeting spoken language** dropdown menu, select the language everyone is speaking from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Update** to change.

**Important:**For other participants to access the meeting spoken language, transcription must be turned off. If there’s an ongoing transcription, they must first turn it off or turn off the feature that started the transcription. Then, they must manually turn transcription on again.

### Get the most out of your captions

To make sure your live captions are as accurate as possible, try these best practices:

* Speak clearly, slowly, and directly into the mic. As your distance from the mic increases, captions may become less accurate.
* Avoid locations with background noise.
* Avoid having multiple people speak at the same time.
* Use the highest-quality Teams-certified equipment available to you.

**Note:**Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### FAQ

#### Where does Teams process the data it uses to provide live captions?

We process the data in the geographical region where your organization is based.

#### What data does Teams use to create the captions?

The Microsoft Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology service, which generates Teams meeting captions, may use a meeting's subject, invitation, participant names, attachments, and recent emails of the participants to improve the accuracy of captions.

#### How does Teams translate live captions?

We use the Microsoft Speech Translation technology powered by Azure Cognitive Services for translating live captions.

#### Who has access to this data?

No one. Microsoft ASR involves no human intervention, and no one can access the meeting audio or any other meeting information at any time.

#### Does Teams store any caption data?

No. Caption data is permanently deleted after the meeting is over.

#### If I don't want Teams to process this data to begin with, can I prevent it?

Yes. Simply don't turn on live captions. Your admin can also disable the feature altogether. Go herefor more info about how to do that.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

Teams can detect what's said in a meeting or group call and present real-time captions.

**Note:**Captions aren't yet available in government clouds on the Teams mobile app.

To access a recap from chat, open the event chat and tap **Apps** > **Recap**. You can also open the recap by tapping the recording or transcript thumbnail.

To view the recap in other events within a series, tap the series invite in your Teams calendar and tap **Apps** > **Recap**. Then, tap the date and time of the event you want to review.

**Notes:**

* Recap doesn’t currently support PSTN calls in Teams.
* Recap notifications, notes, and content aren’t currently available for ad-hoc events and calls.

## Intelligent recap

Get a more personalized rundown of your events with intelligent recap. Save time reviewing with AI-powered features that take you right to the moments you’re looking for. Intelligent recaps for webinars and town halls can be accessed by event organizers, co-organizers, and presenters.

**Notes:**

* Intelligent recap is available as part of [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams events more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to Teams Premium, contact your IT admin.
* Intelligent recap is also available as part of the Microsoft 365 Copilot license.

### Supported languages

Many languages are supported in intelligent recap. For more info, see [Supported languages for Microsoft 365 Copilot](/en-us/office/supported-languages-for-microsoft-365-copilot-94518d61-644b-4118-9492-617eea4801d8). If your event's spoken and transcribed languages are supported, all AI features will be available in Teams Premium.

**Important:**AI-generated content is based on the event transcript and is powered by GPT and other AI models. The AI-generated content may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. Microsoft constantly works to improve the technology in reducing these cases.

## Recording

If you record an event, the recording will be available in the event recap after the event ends. You can tap between tabs to review different elements of the recording.

Tap the full screen icon for a more immersive viewing experience.

![View AI generated notes in Teams meeting recap.](/images/en-us/2b989f23-cb58-4a41-a6f8-c066c4a64d07)

**Notes:**

* To use this feature, the event must be transcribed.
* Due to differences in AI language models, AI notes might be formatted differently, depending on event transcription language. We are continuing to improve these features.

## Mentions

Mentions are parts of an event when your name was mentioned by someone else.

To see mentions of your name in an event recap, tap **@ Mentions**. You'll see all the instances when your name was spoken, as well as a timestamp of when the mention occurred.

![View name mentions in Teams meeting recap.](/images/en-us/65989995-6e82-496f-a233-b9a6836d2dfd)

**Notes:**

* To use name mention markers, the event must be transcribed.
* Name mentions only work if someone's name in the transcription matches their display name.

## Content

In an event recap, tap **Content** to see all files from the event. You'll be able to view files that were attached to the event, shared in chat, or related to the event.

![View shared content in Teams meeting recap.](/images/en-us/6ee2fac3-b6d9-4356-ae1b-56867c9b52fa)

## FAQ

### What data does Teams use to provide Intelligent recap?

Teams uses the event transcript, attendance data, and PPT Live data to provide AI-powered features in Intelligent Recap.

### Does Teams store any event data?

Teams stores event data but Microsoft doesn’t have access to it. How it’s stored depends on policies set by your IT admin. Your event data is stored in the geographic region associated with your organization. Recordings are stored in OneDrive and SharePoint, in accordance with the Microsoft Purview policy. Learn more about managing your SharePoint governance here.

### Do AI-generated notes and AI-generated tasks expire?

AI-generated notes and AI-generated tasks will expire according to your org’s policies. For more information, contact your IT admin.

### Who can access an events' intelligent recap?

People in your org can access an event's intelligent recap if they were invited to the event. Anyone who wasn't invited or isn't in your org won't have access, even if they have the recording link or Teams Premium.

## FAQ

### Why is my meeting recording automatically if I didn’t schedule it that way?

* If you schedule a meeting or event using the town hall or webinar template, automatic recording and transcription will be on by default.   
    
  To turn off automatic recording before the meeting or event starts, open the event details in your Teams calendar and select **Meeting options**  ![Settings icon](/images/en-us/e2a1f329-d95b-7d5e-181c-7c3e12fd9321) > **Recording & transcription** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

### Where is my recording?

If you can’t find a recording:

* Check if there is a message indicating that your recording started. If you don’t see this message, the recording most likely didn’t start and can’t be recovered.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a recording start notification.](/images/en-us/dc21305a-252b-4f92-8b1a-e733b250e474)

  ![Screenshot of a file recycle bin highlighting where to find the second stage recycle bin.](/images/en-us/90900c77-8b4c-4c28-a09c-5538d6301610)
* If you can’t find your recording in OneDrive but see this recording chiclet in your chat history, your recording failed to upload to OneDrive and will be stored in a temporary storage for 21 days. You can retry uploading it to OneDrive or download it to your local device.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a recording chiclet that indicated the recording upload failed.](/images/en-us/e2fbb734-95a5-464a-9a35-a3afd9245f14)

CONTENT:
Communicate clearly and efficiently during multilingual meetings and conferences with language interpretation in Microsoft Teams.

Language interpretation allows professional interpreters to convert what the speaker says into another language in real-time, without disrupting the speaker's original flow of delivery. This simultaneous interpretation will lead to more inclusive meetings, where participants who speak different languages can fully collaborate with each other.

**Notes:**

* Language interpretation is not currently available in [end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings](/en-us/office/use-end-to-end-encryption-for-teams-meetings-a8326d15-d187-49c4-ac99-14c17dbd617c).
* If you turn on [spatial audio](/en-us/office/spatial-audio-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-547b5f81-1825-4ee1-a1cf-f02e12db4fdb) in a meeting with live interpretation, you'll hear the original and translated audio at the same volume. Turn off spatial audio and rejoin the meeting to hear the interpreter's voice clearly with reduced original voice.

## Interpreter experience

Interpreters can hear all speakers and start interpreting immediately after they join a meeting. Once they join, they won't be able to switch rooms themselves.

Interpreters can also switch their translation direction during a Teams meeting by selecting the language they’re currently translating into at the bottom of the meeting window. The language they’re translating into will appear highlighted.

![Screenshot highlighting the interpreter experience in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/51b272e5-69de-4256-b60f-3b905aa99ff1)

## FAQ

### Does Microsoft provide interpreters?

Microsoft does not provide interpreters. Organizations will need to hire their own interpreters to support their interpretation needs.

### Can interpreters join on web?

Language interpretation isn't currently supported for interpreters or attendees joining on Teams for web.

### What information does the interpreter have access to?

Interpreters will have the same permissions as attendees. They'll be able to see the meeting chat, meeting roster, etc.

### How many interpreters can I add to a meeting?

You can add up to 16 different language pairs (for example, translating French to Spanish counts as one language pair). You can assign as many interpreters to the 16 language pairs as needed.

Note: An interpreter can't be an organizer or co-organizer of the meeting.

### What types of meetings does this feature work with?

Language interpretation is supported for regular scheduled meetings, channel meetings, meetings with up to 1000 participants, and webinars.

Breakout rooms are not currently supported. In meetings with breakout rooms, the main meeting can be interpreted, but interpretation will stop when the breakout rooms start.

Language interpretation is not currently available in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Teams meetings.

### Can I turn on captions for a meeting with interpretation?

Captions in a meeting with language interpretation will only caption the main speaker, not the interpreter. If the language of the main speaker changes, the meeting's organizer will need to switch the live captions' spoken language to the correct language for captioning to work.

### Will meeting recordings have both original and translated audio?

Meeting recordings in a meeting with language interpretation only capture the audio of the main channel, or original speaker. The interpreter's audio will not be present on the recording.

Compliance recording is not currently supported in meetings with language interpretation.

### What kind of set up do interpreters need?

Interpreters must join meetings on Teams for desktop. Language selection isn't available on Teams for web or mobile.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

Meeting recordings expire after a period of time set by your IT admin. Organizers can change recording expiration dates.

To learn more, see [Record a meeting in Teams](/en-us/office/record-a-meeting-in-microsoft-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24).

### All other meetings

For non-channel meetings, the recording will be stored in the **Recordings** folder in the meeting organizer's OneDrive folder. If you were invited to the meeting, you can access the recording through the **Files** or **Shared** tabs in the chat, channel, or meeting details.

**Note:**Only the meeting organizer and co-organizers can [edit the recording](/en-us/office/edit-or-delete-a-meeting-transcript-in-microsoft-teams-2f461386-e39a-4444-b9e2-5787da1da11b). But everyone invited to the meeting is able to view the recording.

## Share a link to a meeting recording with others

To share a recording from a meeting chat:

Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### Change transcription language

To ensure transcription accuracy, make sure the meeting spoken language reflects the language everyone is speaking.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

For info about organizer and presenter roles, see [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

**Notes:**

* Teams live transcripts for meetings with recording and/or transcription are stored in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business. The transcript can be accessed through the meeting chat and **Recap** tab in Teams until a meeting organizer deletes the transcript.
* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + The T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™ plans have our 5-year price guarantee so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes (exclusions like taxes and fees apply).
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How fast is 5G home internet (in Mbps) compared to cable?

  T-Mobile All-In or Amplified Home Internet customers delivering typical speeds between 134 mbps – 415 mbps. Typical upload speeds are between 12 – 55 Mbps. 25% of our customers see speeds below and 25% see speeds above these ranges.

  Keep in mind that speeds can vary depending on location, time of day, signal strength and availability, and other factors. Click here for more info.

  While we can’t directly compare speeds for T-Mobile 5G Home Internet vs. Xfinity, Spectrum, Comcast, Cox, etc., you can check your current speeds here and see for yourself. Best of all, you have nothing to lose, since you can try out T-Mobile Home Internet first to make sure you find a plan that works for you.
* ### Do these plans come with 5-Year price guarantee?

  Yes, new and upgrading customers on the T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™ plans are covered by our 5- year price guarantee. 5-year price guarantee means that we won't change the price of fixed-wireless 5G internet data for at least 5 years while you are on an eligible plan. Taxes & fees, voluntary equipment or speed upgrades, future wireless generations, select limited-time promotions, per-use charges, third-party services, and network management practices aren't included. This guarantee starts when you activate or switch to an eligible plan and doesn't restart if you add a line or change plans after that.
* ### What is the T-Mobile Rely Internet Plan?

  Rely Home Internet provides all the essentials for reliable 5G internet at a low monthly rate of $35/month with AutoPay and any T-Mobile voice line.

It comes with unlimited data, a 5G gateway, and taxes & fees included for qualifying accounts. It delivers reliable Wi-Fi with speed that will keep you streaming, working, and playing.
* ### What is the T-Mobile Amplified Internet Plan?

  With T-Mobile Amplified internet, households enjoy the benefits from the Rely plan, plus T-Mobile’s latest 5G gateway for faster speeds that seamlessly support more people and devices. This comes on top of additional benefits like Advanced Cyber Security for added digital peace of mind.

  Beyond the standard security protections included for all 5G Internet users, with Advanced Cyber Security, customers get things like Safe Browsing to help block malicious links along with Anomaly Detection to help protect connected devices from cybercriminals — all of which is easily managed through the T-Life app.

  This plan is ideal for larger families or those with more devices looking to get the most out of their Home Internet. It includes nearly $300/year in value with benefits like:

  + Faster speeds and more powerful performance in more places with our latest 5G Gateway and a mesh unit to boost Wi-Fi performance in those hard-to-reach places.
  + Advanced Cyber Security to keep your devices digitally secure and protected.
  + 24/7 Interactive Live Assistance with Video Support from Assurant Personal TechPro for any Wi-Fi connected smart devices in the home– helping people stay free from tech stress with setup, troubleshooting and maintenance support.
  + Hulu on Us to stream full seasons of exclusive series, plus current episodes, Hulu Originals, hit movies, and more.
  + Paramount+ on Us to stream over 40,000 episodes and hit movies, plus exclusive originals, live sports & more with Paramount+!

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### How is T-Mobile Fiber internet installed?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.
* ### Why is fiber technology better than cable?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will i be charged for installation?

  Nope! Installation is included in the cost of your plan.
* ### Why am I not eligible for 5G internet?

  The service is available in select areas based on T-Mobile's current wireless network. It may not be available in your area yet, but as we expand T-Mobile Home Internet, we'll prioritize areas with the highest demand.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.
* ### How fast is 5G home internet (in Mbps) compared to cable?

  T-Mobile All-In or Amplified Home Internet customers delivering typical speeds between 134 mbps – 415 mbps. Typical upload speeds are between 12 – 55 Mbps. 25% of our customers see speeds below and 25% see speeds above these ranges.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### How is T-Mobile Fiber internet installed?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.
* ### Why is fiber technology better than cable?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will i be charged for installation?

  Nope! Installation is included in the cost of your plan.
* ### Why am I not eligible for 5G internet?

  The service is available in select areas based on T-Mobile's current wireless network. It may not be available in your area yet, but as we expand T-Mobile Home Internet, we'll prioritize areas with the highest demand.

* ## Who is eligible for Home Internet Backup?

  Home Internet Backup is for people with an existing primary internet provider who need a backup connectivity solution for when their primary internet provider has an outage or connectivity goes down.
* ## How do I use Home Internet Backup when my primary internet service provider has an outage?

  Home Internet Backup comes with a 5G Gateway included and takes just minutes to install. Keep your gateway plugged in and when your primary internet connection goes out, simply switch your devices over to your Home Internet Backup Wi-Fi connection to stay online until your primary provider is back up and running.
* ## What is included in the Home Internet Backup Plan?

  Home Internet Backup gives 130 GB of data – enough to keep a typical household connected for up to 7 days a month – and a 5G gateway included for $20 per month with AutoPay.
* ## What happens if I use all my Home Internet Backup full speed data?

  Once you use your 130 GB of monthly full speed data, you’ll stay connected at speeds of up to 600 kbps until your plan resets on the first day of your next billing cycle. Home Internet Backup is intended for use only as a backup in the event of a separate, primary internet provider outage.

* ## When does my full speed data replenish?

  Your data will reset on the first day of your new billing cycle.
* ## What if the gateway is turned on, but no data is used?

  No problem! The gateway can stay plugged in and on, and data will only be used if devices are connected to the Home Internet Backup Wi-Fi, so check to make sure you have disconnected them until an outage occurs. Home Internet Backup is intended for use only as a backup in the event of a separate, primary internet provider outage.
* ## **How long will 130GB of data last?**

  It depends on several factors, including your household's usage behavior, the number of devices connected, and the type of activities you engage in online. However, 130GB of data is enough to keep a typical household connected for 7 days.

* ### I bought T-Mobile 5G Home Internet online or with a Chat Agent. How do I redeem my Virtual Prepaid Mastercard?
