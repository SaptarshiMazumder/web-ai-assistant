* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

Testimonials collected from actual satisfied T-Mobile Home Internet customers.

* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + The T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™  plans have our 5-year price guarantee so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes (exclusions like taxes and fees apply).
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How fast is 5G home internet (in Mbps) compared to cable?

  T-Mobile All-In or Amplified Home Internet customers delivering typical speeds between 134 mbps – 415 mbps. Typical upload speeds are between 12 – 55 Mbps. 25% of our customers see speeds below and 25% see speeds above these ranges.

  Keep in mind that speeds can vary depending on location, time of day, signal strength and availability, and other factors. Click here for more info.

Best of all, you have nothing to lose, since you can try out T-Mobile Home Internet first to make sure you find a plan that works for you.
* ### Do these plans come with 5-Year price guarantee?

  Yes, new and upgrading customers on the T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™ plans are covered by our 5- year price guarantee. 5-year price guarantee means that we won't change the price of fixed-wireless 5G internet data for at least 5 years while you are on an eligible plan. Taxes & fees, voluntary equipment or speed upgrades, future wireless generations, select limited-time promotions, per-use charges, third-party services, and network management practices aren't included.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

* ### Why am I not eligible for 5G internet?

  The service is available in select areas based on T-Mobile's current wireless network. It may not be available in your area yet, but as we expand T-Mobile Home Internet, we'll prioritize areas with the highest demand.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* ### I don't live in any of the cities with a Riot office. Is there an opportunity to work remotely?

  We take a hybrid approach by entrusting teams to decide the right rhythm for in-person vs remote work. With that being said, we’ll still expect most Rioters to live in the same state as their home office (or the same country in the case of our global offices).
* ### I want to work at one of Riot's global offices but I’m not a citizen of that country. Is that possible?

  Working globally depends on the immigration restrictions of the relevant country/region. If you apply to a role in a global office, those recruiting teams will respond if they see a match.
* ### Can I apply for multiple jobs?

  We want applicants to think deeply about their skills and interest—and how they line up with the jobs available at Riot. It's not a good sign if you find yourself applying to as many open positions as possible.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* ### I don't live in any of the cities with a Riot office. Is there an opportunity to work remotely?

  We take a hybrid approach by entrusting teams to decide the right rhythm for in-person vs remote work. With that being said, we’ll still expect most Rioters to live in the same state as their home office (or the same country in the case of our global offices).
* ### I want to work at one of Riot's global offices but I’m not a citizen of that country. Is that possible?

  Working globally depends on the immigration restrictions of the relevant country/region. If you apply to a role in a global office, those recruiting teams will respond if they see a match.
* ### Can I apply for multiple jobs?

  We want applicants to think deeply about their skills and interest—and how they line up with the jobs available at Riot. It's not a good sign if you find yourself applying to as many open positions as possible.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### How is T-Mobile Fiber internet installed?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.
* ### Why is fiber technology better than cable?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will i be charged for installation?

  Nope! Installation is included in the cost of your plan.
* ### Why am I not eligible for 5G internet?

  The service is available in select areas based on T-Mobile's current wireless network. It may not be available in your area yet, but as we expand T-Mobile Home Internet, we'll prioritize areas with the highest demand.

* ### Do these plans come with 5-Year price guarantee?

  Yes, new and upgrading customers on the T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™ plans are covered by our 5- year price guarantee. 5-year price guarantee means that we won't change the price of fixed-wireless 5G internet data for at least 5 years while you are on an eligible plan. Taxes & fees, voluntary equipment or speed upgrades, future wireless generations, select limited-time promotions, per-use charges, third-party services, and network management practices aren't included.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.

  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

  The service is available in select areas based on T-Mobile's current wireless network. It may not be available in your area yet, but as we expand T-Mobile Home Internet, we'll prioritize areas with the highest demand.

IAM Policies Hands On
Introduction to IAM Policies

Let's examine IAM policies in depth. First, navigate to the users section. For example, the user Stephane is part of the admin group, which grants administrator access permissions to AWS.

Using the user Stephane to access the IAM console, you can see the user listed under users. Since Stephane belongs to the admin group, they have permission to perform any action as an administrator.

Removing User from Admin Group

To demonstrate permission changes, remove the user Stephane from the admin group. Once removed, Stephane loses the administrator permissions previously granted by the group.

After removal, refreshing the users page results in an access denied error, indicating that the user no longer has permission to perform the iamListUsers action. This confirms that removing a user from a group revokes their permissions accordingly.

Restoring Permissions by Attaching Policies

To restore permissions for Stephane, navigate to the user and add permissions. Instead of adding the user back to a group, attach policies directly to the user. For example, attach the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy to allow read-only access to IAM resources.

After attaching the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy, refreshing the users page allows viewing users and user groups but restricts creating new groups. Attempting to create a group results in an access denied error, demonstrating that read-only access limits modification capabilities.

This example illustrates that permissions should be granted strictly according to the user's required actions. To allow creating groups, a broader permission set such as IAM full access must be attached.

Creating User Groups and Assigning Policies

Next, create a new group named developers. Add the user Stephane to this group and attach any policy, such as AlexaForBusiness, to demonstrate policy inheritance through groups.

Also, re-add Stephane to the admin group. Now, the user Stephane has multiple permission policies attached: administrator access inherited from the admin group, AlexaForBusiness managed policy from the developers group, and the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy attached directly.

This demonstrates how permissions can be inherited from multiple sources, including groups and direct attachments.

Understanding IAM Policies in Detail

Navigate to the policies section to examine specific policies. For example, the AdministratorAccess policy grants full access to all AWS services and resources.

Viewing the JSON of this policy reveals that it allows all actions (Action: "*") on all resources (Resource: "*"). This effectively grants administrator access.

In contrast, the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy authorizes specific API calls such as List and Get actions on IAM resources. The JSON document lists allowed actions like iam:ListUsers and iam:GetUser with effect set to allow.

Using wildcards such as Get* or List* groups multiple API calls together, simplifying policy definitions.

Creating Custom IAM Policies

You can create custom policies using either the visual editor or the JSON editor. For example, to create a policy that allows only ListUsers and GetUser actions on IAM, select these actions in the visual editor and specify the resources to which the policy applies.

After creating the policy, review the JSON to confirm that it includes the intended permissions. This custom policy can then be attached to users or groups as needed.

Cleaning Up and Finalizing

To conclude, delete the developers group if it is no longer needed. Remove any directly attached policies such as IAMReadOnlyAccess from the user Stephane, leaving only the admin group membership with administrator access.

Verifying the IAM console shows that the user Stephane has full access again, confirming that permissions are correctly managed through group memberships and attached policies.

Key Takeaways
IAM user permissions are managed through group memberships and attached policies.
Removing a user from an admin group revokes their administrator access immediately.
Read-only access policies allow viewing but restrict modification actions.
Custom IAM policies can be created using the visual or JSON editor to specify precise permissions.

IAM Policies Hands On
Introduction to IAM Policies

Let's examine IAM policies in depth. First, navigate to the users section. For example, the user Stephane is part of the admin group, which grants administrator access permissions to AWS.

Using the user Stephane to access the IAM console, you can see the user listed under users. Since Stephane belongs to the admin group, they have permission to perform any action as an administrator.

Removing User from Admin Group

To demonstrate permission changes, remove the user Stephane from the admin group. Once removed, Stephane loses the administrator permissions previously granted by the group.

After removal, refreshing the users page results in an access denied error, indicating that the user no longer has permission to perform the iamListUsers action. This confirms that removing a user from a group revokes their permissions accordingly.

Restoring Permissions by Attaching Policies

To restore permissions for Stephane, navigate to the user and add permissions. Instead of adding the user back to a group, attach policies directly to the user. For example, attach the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy to allow read-only access to IAM resources.

After attaching the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy, refreshing the users page allows viewing users and user groups but restricts creating new groups. Attempting to create a group results in an access denied error, demonstrating that read-only access limits modification capabilities.

This example illustrates that permissions should be granted strictly according to the user's required actions. To allow creating groups, a broader permission set such as IAM full access must be attached.

Creating User Groups and Assigning Policies

Next, create a new group named developers. Add the user Stephane to this group and attach any policy, such as AlexaForBusiness, to demonstrate policy inheritance through groups.

Also, re-add Stephane to the admin group. Now, the user Stephane has multiple permission policies attached: administrator access inherited from the admin group, AlexaForBusiness managed policy from the developers group, and the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy attached directly.

This demonstrates how permissions can be inherited from multiple sources, including groups and direct attachments.

Understanding IAM Policies in Detail

Navigate to the policies section to examine specific policies. For example, the AdministratorAccess policy grants full access to all AWS services and resources.

Viewing the JSON of this policy reveals that it allows all actions (Action: "*") on all resources (Resource: "*"). This effectively grants administrator access.

In contrast, the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy authorizes specific API calls such as List and Get actions on IAM resources. The JSON document lists allowed actions like iam:ListUsers and iam:GetUser with effect set to allow.

Using wildcards such as Get* or List* groups multiple API calls together, simplifying policy definitions.

Creating Custom IAM Policies

You can create custom policies using either the visual editor or the JSON editor. For example, to create a policy that allows only ListUsers and GetUser actions on IAM, select these actions in the visual editor and specify the resources to which the policy applies.

After creating the policy, review the JSON to confirm that it includes the intended permissions. This custom policy can then be attached to users or groups as needed.

Cleaning Up and Finalizing

To conclude, delete the developers group if it is no longer needed. Remove any directly attached policies such as IAMReadOnlyAccess from the user Stephane, leaving only the admin group membership with administrator access.

Verifying the IAM console shows that the user Stephane has full access again, confirming that permissions are correctly managed through group memberships and attached policies.

Key Takeaways
IAM user permissions are managed through group memberships and attached policies.
Removing a user from an admin group revokes their administrator access immediately.
Read-only access policies allow viewing but restrict modification actions.
Custom IAM policies can be created using the visual or JSON editor to specify precise permissions.

AI may make mistakes. Verify for accuracy.

The area
2 Chome-2-1 Dogenzaka, Shibuya 150-0043 Tokyo Prefecture
Neighborhood: Shibuya / Harajuku / Ebisu
There are countless opportunities to shop in the Shibuya and Harajuku districts, especially in shops that focus on Japan's "Kawaii" culture. The trendiest areas are around Shibuya’s Center district, Harajuku's Takeshita-dori and in Omotesando. If you need to recharge from all the shopping, you can easily refresh yourself in Meiji Jingu or Sasaki Park. In contrast, Ebisu has a more grown up ambiance of calm and cool. At the Museum of Yebisu Beer you can learn about the beer that was responsible for the town’s name, and enjoy dining at the popular noodle shops in the surrounding area.

Definitely a must-visit if you’re in Tokyo — it’s one of the most iconic and busiest pedestrian crossings in the world. When the light turns green, you’ll see hundreds of people flowing from every direction at once. It’s a surreal experience, especially at night when the neon lights and giant screens light up the intersection. There’s always something going on around the area too — street performers, pop-up ads, and people filming content. For one of the best views from above, head to the Magnet mall building. On the rooftop, there’s a small bar with a terrace that overlooks the crossing — a perfect spot for taking photos or videos. The bar itself isn’t anything special and entry requires you to buy at least one drink, but the view makes it absolutely worth it. Tip: Try visiting at around 5-7pm or after sunset for the most dramatic visuals. And if the Magnet rooftop feels too crowded, other viewpoints include the Starbucks in Tsutaya or the Shibuya Sky observation deck — though those might be busier or more expensive.

A definite must stop in Tokyo and there are a number of viewing spots from above. You can view for free from the walkway in the shopping centre, go to Starbucks and compete with the crowds for the window, pay a fortune to go up the Shibuya scramble tower (which may be too high???) or go to the Magnet bar - in the block on the right next to Starbucks (as you look at Starbucks). Take the lift to the top floor and for a small fee there is a small bar where you get a drink (coffee/beer/soft drink) included in the price. Plenty of space and a lovely place for an early evening beer to watch the crossing.

I admit it: I arrived very charged. A thousand videos watched, epic scenes in movies, skyrocketing expectations. I imagined a giant intersection, like Times Square with Godzilla crossing the stripes. Instead... eh. It's big, yes, but not HUGE. Live it almost looks like a normal crossing... only with more people, lights and selfie sticks per square meter. But be careful: it's not a scam. It's a perfectly choreographed little mess. When the green shoots in and hundreds of people cross at once from every direction, you feel part of an urban musical in which everyone acts without knowing they are doing it. The real show? Look at it from above: Starbucks or one of the various viewpoints around. That's where you get the magic. On the ground you're just a guy trying not to get hit by a tourist on a scooter. In summary: – Mythical? Yes. – Giant as in the videos? Not really. – To see at least once? Absolutely not. Shibuya Crossing: small, crowded, a bit overrated, but in the end... it gets to your heart. And in Instagram stories. 📸✨

The Shibuya Crossing is a must-see pedestrian crossing in Tokyo, photographed from all angles. A human tide passes through it alternately with cars, whether diagonally or horizontally. Do not hesitate to go day or night, the effect will not be the same! You can observe it for free from many places, such as Shibuya Station tonight, shops nearby or for a fee from buildings like ShibuyaSky for example.

Stepping into Shibuya Crossing is like stepping into the pulse of Tokyo. When the lights turn red for cars, hundreds (sometimes thousands) of pedestrians flood the intersection from all directions. It’s a mesmerizing sight to see people moving in perfect synchronization, crossing in every direction, yet it’s incredibly organized despite the chaos. It is a must see sight for sure. Also the shops nearby are very nice options to buy sourveniers and gifts from Japan.

This is very busy but it's unnecessarily filled with tourists stopping to take pics and video. Surprisingly the traffic moves smooth regardless of the crowd. No cars are honking (not allowed). No cars get "stuck" in the middle of the intersection. It's overcrowded b/c the Shibuya train station is also at that intersection and it was under constructions in Oct 2024.

Shibuya Crossing is an amazing place where thousands of people cross the street in every direction every few minutes. We got to cross the street and then we went up into a building a few floors to take some pictures of the crowds below. It is the bussiest street crossing in the world.

Lots of shops and restaurants in Shibuya, but the crossing was a bit disappointing to me as I realised - it's just a road crossing! OK there's lots of stripes diagonally but that't because Japanese people have to follow the rules and they would not cross diagonally until you draw a crossing on the road. Good for a photo but not much else, I went up to the Starbucks for a free photo otherwise there are some restaurants/bars that have a view higher up.

This is a must see if you are in Tokyo. Go on the subway/JR lines it is right outside the subway exit. It is like a ballet with cars halting people swarming across is all directions then suddenly stopping and cars going again. I could watch it for hours.

One of the main Landmarks of Tokyo
May 2025 • Friends
This is one of the main landmarks of Tokyo. It is just a square, but I think it's so iconic that it's worth a visit. You should definitely cross the diagonal crosswalk and take a picture or two. There are quite a few options to view the crossing from above. We booked the shibuya sky, which is pretty high up and you have to book well in advance, right when the tickets are released. But there are plenty of other options to view the crossing from a bit closer. What's also fun is to take a timelapse video of people crossing the crosswalks. All in all, I think it's a touristy thing to do but still worth it.

It's right in front of the subway station. It's a very well-known place where hundreds of people pass by at the same time without anyone hitting. It's a place where many Japanese fixed cars go by. Known for the movie Fast and Furious Tokyo

Fun while crossing
Jul 2025 • Couples
We first saw Shibuya Crossing a few minutes after arriving by bus from the airport to Tokyo, still with our suitcases. And then we returned here several more times during our stay in Tokyo.

It was fun to watch people (mostly tourists, Japanese people just crossing) taking pictures, filming and posing while crossing. We did the same. :-) Yes, it is an iconic place and if you are in Tokyo, you definitely shouldn't miss it.

Very busy intersection, in itself not so special but nice to have walked over once.
Many nice shops in DE neighborhood. At DE Shibuya crossing is a restaurant/bar where you have a view over the intersection.

Our iconic neighborhood where thousands of people run to the right to the left, with shops that appeal mostly to under 20, where the nightlife is bustling...
Going with a kid can be torture,even with hundreds in the subway.
Going just to see one day, it’s probably the cheapest Shopping and dining in Tokyo.
If you’re staying in the center, you can get around 15dk from Tokyo Station with one line.

Great buzz in the streets around...
Jun 2025 • Family
The reality is that its a series of zebra crossings with very bright bill boards surrounding it and loads of people around. That said it was fun to see and worth a visit if you are heading to Tokyo just for the buzz in the streets around it, which is the bit we enjoyed most

Zebra crossing in all directions
Sep 2024 • Friends
Shibuya Crossing is one of the most known sightseeing points in Tokyo, the main city in Japan. In fact, it is a place, where some roads link and there are some zebra crossings and you can see, how a lot of people cross the roads in all directions. Really stress! All full of people! A curious place in a very modern city. Not more.

# Simple Crawling

This guide covers the basics of web crawling with Crawl4AI. You'll learn how to set up a crawler, make your first request, and understand the response.

## Basic Usage

Set up a simple crawl using `BrowserConfig` and `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig()  # Default browser configuration
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()   # Default crawl run configuration

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )
        print(result.markdown)  # Print clean markdown content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

## Understanding the Response

The `arun()` method returns a `CrawlResult` object with several useful properties. Here's a quick overview (see [CrawlResult](../../api/crawl-result/) for complete details):

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    markdown_generator=DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
        content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.6),
        options={"ignore_links": True}
    )
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=config
)

# Different content formats
print(result.html)         # Raw HTML
print(result.cleaned_html) # Cleaned HTML
print(result.markdown.raw_markdown) # Raw markdown from cleaned html
print(result.markdown.fit_markdown) # Most relevant content in markdown

# Check success status
print(result.success)      # True if crawl succeeded
print(result.status_code)  # HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404)

# Access extracted media and links
print(result.media)        # Dictionary of found media (images, videos, audio)
print(result.links)        # Dictionary of internal and external links
Copy
```

## Adding Basic Options

Customize your crawl using `CrawlerRunConfig`:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    word_count_threshold=10,        # Minimum words per content block
    exclude_external_links=True,    # Remove external links
    remove_overlay_elements=True,   # Remove popups/modals
    process_iframes=True           # Process iframe content
)

result = await crawler.arun(
    url="
    config=run_config
)
Copy
```

## Handling Errors

Always check if the crawl was successful:

```
run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)

if not result.success:
    print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")
    print(f"Status code: {result.status_code}")
Copy
```

## Logging and Debugging

Enable verbose logging in `BrowserConfig`:

```
browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)

async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig()
    result = await crawler.arun(url=" config=run_config)
Copy
```

## Complete Example

Here's a more comprehensive example demonstrating common usage patterns:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.async_configs import BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(verbose=True)
    run_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        # Content filtering
        word_count_threshold=10,
        excluded_tags=['form', 'header'],
        exclude_external_links=True,

        # Content processing
        process_iframes=True,
        remove_overlay_elements=True,

        # Cache control
        cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED  # Use cache if available
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_config
        )

        if result.success:
            # Print clean content
            print("Content:", result.markdown[:500])  # First 500 chars

            # Process images
            for image in result.media["images"]:
                print(f"Found image: {image['src']}")

            # Process links
            for link in result.links["internal"]:
                print(f"Internal link: {link['href']}")

        else:
            print(f"Crawl failed: {result.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

# Crawl Dispatcher

We’re excited to announce a **Crawl Dispatcher** module that can handle **thousands** of crawling tasks simultaneously. By efficiently managing system resources (memory, CPU, network), this dispatcher ensures high-performance data extraction at scale. It also provides **real-time monitoring** of each crawler’s status, memory usage, and overall progress.

Stay tuned—this feature is **coming soon** in an upcoming release of Crawl4AI! For the latest news, keep an eye on our changelogs and follow @unclecode on X.

# Deep Crawling

One of Crawl4AI's most powerful features is its ability to perform **configurable deep crawling** that can explore websites beyond a single page. With fine-tuned control over crawl depth, domain boundaries, and content filtering, Crawl4AI gives you the tools to extract precisely the content you need.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

1. How to set up a **Basic Deep Crawler** with BFS strategy
2. Understanding the difference between **streamed and non-streamed** output
3. Implementing **filters and scorers** to target specific content
4. Creating **advanced filtering chains** for sophisticated crawls
5. Using **BestFirstCrawling** for intelligent exploration prioritization

> **Prerequisites**  
> - You’ve completed or read [AsyncWebCrawler Basics](../simple-crawling/) to understand how to run a simple crawl.  
> - You know how to configure `CrawlerRunConfig`.

---

## 1. Quick Example

Here's a minimal code snippet that implements a basic deep crawl using the **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy

async def main():
    # Configure a 2-level deep crawl
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
            max_depth=2, 
            include_external=False
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        verbose=True
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

        print(f"Crawled {len(results)} pages in total")

        # Access individual results
        for result in results[:3]:  # Show first 3 results
            print(f"URL: {result.url}")
            print(f"Depth: {result.metadata.get('depth', 0)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**What's happening?**  
- `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=2, include_external=False)` instructs Crawl4AI to:
- Crawl the starting page (depth 0) plus 2 more levels
- Stay within the same domain (don't follow external links)
- Each result contains metadata like the crawl depth
- Results are returned as a list after all crawling is complete

---

## 2. Understanding Deep Crawling Strategy Options

### 2.1 BFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Breadth-First Search)

The **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a breadth-first approach, exploring all links at one depth before moving deeper:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=50,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.3,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.2 DFSDeepCrawlStrategy (Depth-First Search)

The **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy** uses a depth-first approach, explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import DFSDeepCrawlStrategy

# Basic configuration
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,               # Crawl initial page + 2 levels deep
    include_external=False,    # Stay within the same domain
    max_pages=30,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
    score_threshold=0.5,       # Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (optional)
)
Copy
```

**Key parameters:**
- **`max_depth`**: Number of levels to crawl beyond the starting page
- **`include_external`**: Whether to follow links to other domains
- **`max_pages`**: Maximum number of pages to crawl (default: infinite)
- **`score_threshold`**: Minimum score for URLs to be crawled (default: -inf)
- **`filter_chain`**: FilterChain instance for URL filtering
- **`url_scorer`**: Scorer instance for evaluating URLs

### 2.3 BestFirstCrawlingStrategy (⭐️ - Recommended Deep crawl strategy)

For more intelligent crawling, use **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy** with scorers to prioritize the most relevant pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

# Create a scorer
scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7
)

# Configure the strategy
strategy = BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    include_external=False,
    url_scorer=scorer,
    max_pages=25,              # Maximum number of pages to crawl (optional)
)
Copy
```

This crawling approach:
- Evaluates each discovered URL based on scorer criteria
- Visits higher-scoring pages first
- Helps focus crawl resources on the most relevant content
- Can limit total pages crawled with `max_pages`
- Does not need `score_threshold` as it naturally prioritizes by score

---

## 3. Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Results

Crawl4AI can return results in two modes:

### 3.1 Non-Streaming Mode (Default)

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=False  # Default behavior
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Wait for ALL results to be collected before returning
    results = await crawler.arun(" config=config)

    for result in results:
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**When to use non-streaming mode:**
- You need the complete dataset before processing
- You're performing batch operations on all results together
- Crawl time isn't a critical factor

### 3.2 Streaming Mode

```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(max_depth=1),
    stream=True  # Enable streaming
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Returns an async iterator
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        # Process each result as it becomes available
        process_result(result)
Copy
```

**Benefits of streaming mode:**
- Process results immediately as they're discovered
- Start working with early results while crawling continues
- Better for real-time applications or progressive display
- Reduces memory pressure when handling many pages

---

## 4. Filtering Content with Filter Chains

Filters help you narrow down which pages to crawl. Combine multiple filters using **FilterChain** for powerful targeting.

### 4.1 Basic URL Pattern Filter

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, URLPatternFilter

# Only follow URLs containing "blog" or "docs"
url_filter = URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*blog*", "*docs*"])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([url_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.2 Combining Multiple Filters

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    URLPatternFilter,
    DomainFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)

# Create a chain of filters
filter_chain = FilterChain([
    # Only follow URLs with specific patterns
    URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*"]),

    # Only crawl specific domains
    DomainFilter(
        allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
        blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
    ),

    # Only include specific content types
    ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
])

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        filter_chain=filter_chain
    )
)
Copy
```

### 4.3 Available Filter Types

Crawl4AI includes several specialized filters:

* **`URLPatternFilter`**: Matches URL patterns using wildcard syntax
* **`DomainFilter`**: Controls which domains to include or exclude
* **`ContentTypeFilter`**: Filters based on HTTP Content-Type
* **`ContentRelevanceFilter`**: Uses similarity to a text query
* **`SEOFilter`**: Evaluates SEO elements (meta tags, headers, etc.)

---

## 5. Using Scorers for Prioritized Crawling

Scorers assign priority values to discovered URLs, helping the crawler focus on the most relevant content first.

### 5.1 KeywordRelevanceScorer

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy

# Create a keyword relevance scorer
keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
    keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
    weight=0.7  # Importance of this scorer (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
        max_depth=2,
        url_scorer=keyword_scorer
    ),
    stream=True  # Recommended with BestFirstCrawling
)

# Results will come in order of relevance score
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
        score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
        print(f"Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")
Copy
```

**How scorers work:**
- Evaluate each discovered URL before crawling
- Calculate relevance based on various signals
- Help the crawler make intelligent choices about traversal order

---

## 6. Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 6.1 SEO Filter for Quality Assessment

The **SEOFilter** helps you identify pages with strong SEO characteristics:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, SEOFilter

# Create an SEO filter that looks for specific keywords in page metadata
seo_filter = SEOFilter(
    threshold=0.5,  # Minimum score (0.0 to 1.0)
    keywords=["tutorial", "guide", "documentation"]
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([seo_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

### 6.2 Content Relevance Filter

The **ContentRelevanceFilter** analyzes the actual content of pages:

```
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import FilterChain, ContentRelevanceFilter

# Create a content relevance filter
relevance_filter = ContentRelevanceFilter(
    query="Web crawling and data extraction with Python",
    threshold=0.7  # Minimum similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
        max_depth=1,
        filter_chain=FilterChain([relevance_filter])
    )
)
Copy
```

This filter:
- Measures semantic similarity between query and page content
- It's a BM25-based relevance filter using head section content

---

## 7. Building a Complete Advanced Crawler

This example combines multiple techniques for a sophisticated crawl:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BestFirstCrawlingStrategy
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.filters import (
    FilterChain,
    DomainFilter,
    URLPatternFilter,
    ContentTypeFilter
)
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling.scorers import KeywordRelevanceScorer

async def run_advanced_crawler():
    # Create a sophisticated filter chain
    filter_chain = FilterChain([
        # Domain boundaries
        DomainFilter(
            allowed_domains=["docs.example.com"],
            blocked_domains=["old.docs.example.com"]
        ),

        # URL patterns to include
        URLPatternFilter(patterns=["*guide*", "*tutorial*", "*blog*"]),

        # Content type filtering
        ContentTypeFilter(allowed_types=["text/html"])
    ])

    # Create a relevance scorer
    keyword_scorer = KeywordRelevanceScorer(
        keywords=["crawl", "example", "async", "configuration"],
        weight=0.7
    )

    # Set up the configuration
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BestFirstCrawlingStrategy(
            max_depth=2,
            include_external=False,
            filter_chain=filter_chain,
            url_scorer=keyword_scorer
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        stream=True,
        verbose=True
    )

    # Execute the crawl
    results = []
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        async for result in await crawler.arun(" config=config):
            results.append(result)
            score = result.metadata.get("score", 0)
            depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
            print(f"Depth: {depth} | Score: {score:.2f} | {result.url}")

    # Analyze the results
    print(f"Crawled {len(results)} high-value pages")
    print(f"Average score: {sum(r.metadata.get('score', 0) for r in results) / len(results):.2f}")

    # Group by depth
    depth_counts = {}
    for result in results:
        depth = result.metadata.get("depth", 0)
        depth_counts[depth] = depth_counts.get(depth, 0) + 1

    print("Pages crawled by depth:")
    for depth, count in sorted(depth_counts.items()):
        print(f"  Depth {depth}: {count} pages")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_advanced_crawler())
Copy
```

---

## 8. Limiting and Controlling Crawl Size

### 8.1 Using max\_pages

You can limit the total number of pages crawled with the `max_pages` parameter:

```
# Limit to exactly 20 pages regardless of depth
strategy = BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=3,
    max_pages=20
)
Copy
```

This feature is useful for:
- Controlling API costs
- Setting predictable execution times
- Focusing on the most important content
- Testing crawl configurations before full execution

### 8.2 Using score\_threshold

For BFS and DFS strategies, you can set a minimum score threshold to only crawl high-quality pages:

```
# Only follow links with scores above 0.4
strategy = DFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,
    url_scorer=KeywordRelevanceScorer(keywords=["api", "guide", "reference"]),
    score_threshold=0.4  # Skip URLs with scores below this value
)
Copy
```

Note that for BestFirstCrawlingStrategy, score\_threshold is not needed since pages are already processed in order of highest score first.

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Tips

1.**Set realistic limits.** Be cautious with `max_depth` values > 3, which can exponentially increase crawl size. Use `max_pages` to set hard limits.

2.**Don't neglect the scoring component.** BestFirstCrawling works best with well-tuned scorers. Experiment with keyword weights for optimal prioritization.

3.**Be a good web citizen.** Respect robots.txt. (disabled by default)

4.**Handle page errors gracefully.** Not all pages will be accessible. Check `result.status` when processing results.

5.**Balance breadth vs. depth.** Choose your strategy wisely - BFS for comprehensive coverage, DFS for deep exploration, BestFirst for focused relevance-based crawling.

---

## 10. Summary & Next Steps

In this **Deep Crawling with Crawl4AI** tutorial, you learned to:

* Configure **BFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, **DFSDeepCrawlStrategy**, and **BestFirstCrawlingStrategy**
* Process results in streaming or non-streaming mode

# Adaptive Web Crawling

## Introduction

Traditional web crawlers follow predetermined patterns, crawling pages blindly without knowing when they've gathered enough information. **Adaptive Crawling** changes this paradigm by introducing intelligence into the crawling process.

Think of it like research: when you're looking for information, you don't read every book in the library. You stop when you've found sufficient information to answer your question. That's exactly what Adaptive Crawling does for web scraping.

## Key Concepts

### The Problem It Solves

When crawling websites for specific information, you face two challenges:
1. **Under-crawling**: Stopping too early and missing crucial information
2. **Over-crawling**: Wasting resources by crawling irrelevant pages

Adaptive Crawling solves both by using a three-layer scoring system that determines when you have "enough" information.

### How It Works

The AdaptiveCrawler uses three metrics to measure information sufficiency:

* **Coverage**: How well your collected pages cover the query terms
* **Consistency**: Whether the information is coherent across pages
* **Saturation**: Detecting when new pages aren't adding new information

When these metrics indicate sufficient information has been gathered, crawling stops automatically.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, AdaptiveCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Create an adaptive crawler (config is optional)
        adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)

        # Start crawling with a query
        result = await adaptive.digest(
            start_url="
            query="async context managers"
        )

        # View statistics
        adaptive.print_stats()

        # Get the most relevant content
        relevant_pages = adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=5)
        for page in relevant_pages:
            print(f"- {page['url']} (score: {page['score']:.2f})")
Copy
```

### Configuration Options

```
from crawl4ai import AdaptiveConfig

config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.8,    # Stop when 80% confident (default: 0.7)
    max_pages=30,               # Maximum pages to crawl (default: 20)
    top_k_links=5,              # Links to follow per page (default: 3)
    min_gain_threshold=0.05     # Minimum expected gain to continue (default: 0.1)
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
Copy
```

## Crawling Strategies

Adaptive Crawling supports two distinct strategies for determining information sufficiency:

### Statistical Strategy (Default)

The statistical strategy uses pure information theory and term-based analysis:

* **Fast and efficient** - No API calls or model loading
* **Term-based coverage** - Analyzes query term presence and distribution
* **No external dependencies** - Works offline
* **Best for**: Well-defined queries with specific terminology

```
# Default configuration uses statistical strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="statistical",  # This is the default
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)
Copy
```

### Embedding Strategy

The embedding strategy uses semantic embeddings for deeper understanding:

* **Semantic understanding** - Captures meaning beyond exact term matches
* **Query expansion** - Automatically generates query variations
* **Gap-driven selection** - Identifies semantic gaps in knowledge
* **Validation-based stopping** - Uses held-out queries to validate coverage
* **Best for**: Complex queries, ambiguous topics, conceptual understanding

```
# Configure embedding strategy
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",  # Default
    n_query_variations=10,  # Generate 10 query variations
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1  # Stop if completely irrelevant
)

# With custom embedding provider (e.g., OpenAI)
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",
    embedding_llm_config={
        'provider': 'openai/text-embedding-3-small',
        'api_token': 'your-api-key'
    }
)
Copy
```

### Strategy Comparison

| Feature | Statistical | Embedding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Moderate (API calls) |
| **Cost** | Free | Depends on provider |
| **Accuracy** | Good for exact terms | Excellent for concepts |
| **Dependencies** | None | Embedding model/API |
| **Query Understanding** | Literal | Semantic |
| **Best Use Case** | Technical docs, specific terms | Research, broad topics |

### Embedding Strategy Configuration

The embedding strategy offers fine-tuned control through several parameters:

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    strategy="embedding",

    # Model configuration
    embedding_model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    embedding_llm_config=None,  # Use for API-based embeddings

    # Query expansion
    n_query_variations=10,  # Number of query variations to generate

    # Coverage parameters
    embedding_coverage_radius=0.2,  # Distance threshold for coverage
    embedding_k_exp=3.0,  # Exponential decay factor (higher = stricter)

    # Stopping criteria
    embedding_min_relative_improvement=0.1,  # Min improvement to continue
    embedding_validation_min_score=0.3,  # Min validation score
    embedding_min_confidence_threshold=0.1,  # Below this = irrelevant

    # Link selection
    embedding_overlap_threshold=0.85,  # Similarity for deduplication

    # Display confidence mapping
    embedding_quality_min_confidence=0.7,  # Min displayed confidence
    embedding_quality_max_confidence=0.95  # Max displayed confidence
)
Copy
```

### Handling Irrelevant Queries

The embedding strategy can detect when a query is completely unrelated to the content:

```
# This will stop quickly with low confidence
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="how to cook pasta"  # Irrelevant to Python docs
)

# Check if query was irrelevant
if result.metrics.get('is_irrelevant', False):
    print("Query is unrelated to the content!")
Copy
```

## When to Use Adaptive Crawling

### Perfect For:

* **Research Tasks**: Finding comprehensive information about a topic
* **Question Answering**: Gathering sufficient context to answer specific queries
* **Knowledge Base Building**: Creating focused datasets for AI/ML applications
* **Competitive Intelligence**: Collecting complete information about specific products/features

### Not Recommended For:

* **Full Site Archiving**: When you need every page regardless of content
* **Structured Data Extraction**: When targeting specific, known page patterns
* **Real-time Monitoring**: When you need continuous updates

## Understanding the Output

### Confidence Score

The confidence score (0-1) indicates how sufficient the gathered information is:
- **0.0-0.3**: Insufficient information, needs more crawling
- **0.3-0.6**: Partial information, may answer basic queries
- **0.6-0.7**: Good coverage, can answer most queries
- **0.7-1.0**: Excellent coverage, comprehensive information

### Statistics Display

```
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=False)  # Summary table
adaptive.print_stats(detailed=True)   # Detailed metrics
Copy
```

The summary shows:
- Pages crawled vs. confidence achieved
- Coverage, consistency, and saturation scores
- Crawling efficiency metrics

## Persistence and Resumption

### Saving Progress

```
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    save_state=True,
    state_path="my_crawl_state.json"
)

# Crawl will auto-save progress
result = await adaptive.digest(start_url, query)
Copy
```

### Resuming a Crawl

```
# Resume from saved state
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url,
    query,
    resume_from="my_crawl_state.json"
)
Copy
```

### Exporting Knowledge Base

```
# Export collected pages to JSONL
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")

# Import into another session
new_adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)
new_adaptive.import_knowledge_base("knowledge_base.jsonl")
Copy
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Query Formulation

* Use specific, descriptive queries
* Include key terms you expect to find
* Avoid overly broad queries

### 2. Threshold Tuning

* Start with default (0.7) for general use
* Lower to 0.5-0.6 for exploratory crawling
* Raise to 0.8+ for exhaustive coverage

### 3. Performance Optimization

* Use appropriate `max_pages` limits
* Adjust `top_k_links` based on site structure
* Enable caching for repeat crawls

### 4. Link Selection

* The crawler prioritizes links based on:
* Relevance to query
* Expected information gain
* URL structure and depth

## Examples

### Research Assistant

```
# Gather information about a programming concept
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="python decorators implementation patterns"
)

# Get the most relevant excerpts
for doc in adaptive.get_relevant_content(top_k=3):
    print(f"\nFrom: {doc['url']}")
    print(f"Relevance: {doc['score']:.2%}")
    print(doc['content'][:500] + "...")
Copy
```

### Knowledge Base Builder

```
# Build a focused knowledge base about machine learning
queries = [
    "supervised learning algorithms",
    "neural network architectures", 
    "model evaluation metrics"
]

for query in queries:
    await adaptive.digest(
        start_url="
        query=query
    )

# Export combined knowledge base
adaptive.export_knowledge_base("ml_knowledge.jsonl")
Copy
```

### API Documentation Crawler

```
# Intelligently crawl API documentation
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.85,  # Higher threshold for completeness
    max_pages=30
)

adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
result = await adaptive.digest(
    start_url="
    query="authentication endpoints rate limits"
)
Copy
```

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from traditional crawling?**
A: Traditional crawling follows fixed patterns (BFS/DFS). Adaptive crawling makes intelligent decisions about which links to follow and when to stop based on information gain.

**Q: Can I use this with JavaScript-heavy sites?**
A: Yes! AdaptiveCrawler inherits all capabilities from AsyncWebCrawler, including JavaScript execution.

**Q: How does it handle large websites?**
A: The algorithm naturally limits crawling to relevant sections. Use `max_pages` as a safety limit.

**Q: Can I customize the scoring algorithms?**
A: Advanced users can implement custom strategies. See [Adaptive Strategies](../../advanced/adaptive-strategies/).

# Getting Started with Crawl4AI

Welcome to **Crawl4AI**, an open-source LLM-friendly Web Crawler & Scraper. In this tutorial, you’ll:

1. Run your **first crawl** using minimal configuration.
2. Generate **Markdown** output (and learn how it’s influenced by content filters).
3. Experiment with a simple **CSS-based extraction** strategy.
4. See a glimpse of **LLM-based extraction** (including open-source and closed-source model options).
5. Crawl a **dynamic** page that loads content via JavaScript.

---

## 1. Introduction

Crawl4AI provides:

* An asynchronous crawler, **`AsyncWebCrawler`**.
* Configurable browser and run settings via **`BrowserConfig`** and **`CrawlerRunConfig`**.
* Automatic HTML-to-Markdown conversion via **`DefaultMarkdownGenerator`** (supports optional filters).
* Multiple extraction strategies (LLM-based or “traditional” CSS/XPath-based).

By the end of this guide, you’ll have performed a basic crawl, generated Markdown, tried out two extraction strategies, and crawled a dynamic page that uses “Load More” buttons or JavaScript updates.

---

## 2. Your First Crawl

Here’s a minimal Python script that creates an **`AsyncWebCrawler`**, fetches a webpage, and prints the first 300 characters of its Markdown output:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("
        print(result.markdown[:300])  # Print first 300 chars

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**What’s happening?**
- **`AsyncWebCrawler`** launches a headless browser (Chromium by default).
- It fetches `
- Crawl4AI automatically converts the HTML into Markdown.

You now have a simple, working crawl!

---

## 3. Basic Configuration (Light Introduction)

Crawl4AI’s crawler can be heavily customized using two main classes:

1. **`BrowserConfig`**: Controls browser behavior (headless or full UI, user agent, JavaScript toggles, etc.).  
2. **`CrawlerRunConfig`**: Controls how each crawl runs (caching, extraction, timeouts, hooking, etc.).

Below is an example with minimal usage:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    browser_conf = BrowserConfig(headless=True)  # or False to see the browser
    run_conf = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_conf) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="
            config=run_conf
        )
        print(result.markdown)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

> IMPORTANT: By default cache mode is set to `CacheMode.ENABLED`. So to have fresh content, you need to set it to `CacheMode.BYPASS`

We’ll explore more advanced config in later tutorials (like enabling proxies, PDF output, multi-tab sessions, etc.). For now, just note how you pass these objects to manage crawling.

---

## 4. Generating Markdown Output

By default, Crawl4AI automatically generates Markdown from each crawled page. However, the exact output depends on whether you specify a **markdown generator** or **content filter**.

* **`result.markdown`**:  
  The direct HTML-to-Markdown conversion.
* **`result.markdown.fit_markdown`**:  
  The same content after applying any configured **content filter** (e.g., `PruningContentFilter`).

### Example: Using a Filter with `DefaultMarkdownGenerator`

```
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.content_filter_strategy import PruningContentFilter
from crawl4ai.markdown_generation_strategy import DefaultMarkdownGenerator

md_generator = DefaultMarkdownGenerator(
    content_filter=PruningContentFilter(threshold=0.4, threshold_type="fixed")
)

config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
    markdown_generator=md_generator
)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(" config=config)
    print("Raw Markdown length:", len(result.markdown.raw_markdown))
    print("Fit Markdown length:", len(result.markdown.fit_markdown))
Copy
```

**Note**: If you do **not** specify a content filter or markdown generator, you’ll typically see only the raw Markdown. `PruningContentFilter` may adds around `50ms` in processing time. We’ll dive deeper into these strategies in a dedicated **Markdown Generation** tutorial.

---

## 5. Simple Data Extraction (CSS-based)

Crawl4AI can also extract structured data (JSON) using CSS or XPath selectors. Below is a minimal CSS-based example:

> **New!** Crawl4AI now provides a powerful utility to automatically generate extraction schemas using LLM. This is a one-time cost that gives you a reusable schema for fast, LLM-free extractions:

```
from crawl4ai import JsonCssExtractionStrategy
from crawl4ai import LLMConfig

# Generate a schema (one-time cost)
html = "<div class='product'><h2>Gaming Laptop</h2><span class='price'>$999.99</span></div>"

# Using OpenAI (requires API token)
schema = JsonCssExtractionStrategy.generate_schema(
    html,
    llm_config = LLMConfig(provider="openai/gpt-4o",api_token="your-openai-token")  # Required for OpenAI
)

# Or using Ollama (open source, no token needed)
schema = JsonCssExtractionStrategy.generate_schema(
    html,
    llm_config = LLMConfig(provider="ollama/llama3.3", api_token=None)  # Not needed for Ollama
)

# Use the schema for fast, repeated extractions
strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
Copy
```

For a complete guide on schema generation and advanced usage, see [No-LLM Extraction Strategies](../../extraction/no-llm-strategies/).

Here's a basic extraction example:

```
import asyncio
import json
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def main():
    schema = {
        "name": "Example Items",
        "baseSelector": "div.item",
        "fields": [
            {"name": "title", "selector": "h2", "type": "text"},
            {"name": "link", "selector": "a", "type": "attribute", "attribute": "href"}
        ]
    }

    raw_html = "<div class='item'><h2>Item 1</h2><a href=' 1</a></div>"

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="raw://" + raw_html,
            config=CrawlerRunConfig(
                cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
                extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema)
            )
        )
        # The JSON output is stored in 'extracted_content'
        data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**Why is this helpful?**
- Great for repetitive page structures (e.g., item listings, articles).
- No AI usage or costs.
- The crawler returns a JSON string you can parse or store.

> Tips: You can pass raw HTML to the crawler instead of a URL. To do so, prefix the HTML with `raw://`.

---

## 6. Simple Data Extraction (LLM-based)

For more complex or irregular pages, a language model can parse text intelligently into a structure you define. Crawl4AI supports **open-source** or **closed-source** providers:

* **Open-Source Models** (e.g., `ollama/llama3.3`, `no_token`)
* **OpenAI Models** (e.g., `openai/gpt-4`, requires `api_token`)
* Or any provider supported by the underlying library

Below is an example using **open-source** style (no token) and closed-source:

```
import os
import json
import asyncio
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, LLMConfig
from crawl4ai import LLMExtractionStrategy

class OpenAIModelFee(BaseModel):
    model_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the OpenAI model.")
    input_fee: str = Field(..., description="Fee for input token for the OpenAI model.")
    output_fee: str = Field(
        ..., description="Fee for output token for the OpenAI model."
    )

async def extract_structured_data_using_llm(
    provider: str, api_token: str = None, extra_headers: Dict[str, str] = None
):
    print(f"\n--- Extracting Structured Data with {provider} ---")

    if api_token is None and provider != "ollama":
        print(f"API token is required for {provider}. Skipping this example.")
        return

    browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=True)

    extra_args = {"temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.9, "max_tokens": 2000}
    if extra_headers:
        extra_args["extra_headers"] = extra_headers

    crawler_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        word_count_threshold=1,
        page_timeout=80000,
        extraction_strategy=LLMExtractionStrategy(
            llm_config = LLMConfig(provider=provider,api_token=api_token),
            schema=OpenAIModelFee.model_json_schema(),
            extraction_type="schema",
            instruction="""From the crawled content, extract all mentioned model names along with their fees for input and output tokens. 
            Do not miss any models in the entire content.""",
            extra_args=extra_args,
        ),
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url=" config=crawler_config
        )
        print(result.extracted_content)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    asyncio.run(
        extract_structured_data_using_llm(
            provider="openai/gpt-4o", api_token=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        )
    )
Copy
```

**What’s happening?**
- We define a Pydantic schema (`PricingInfo`) describing the fields we want.
- The LLM extraction strategy uses that schema and your instructions to transform raw text into structured JSON.
- Depending on the **provider** and **api\_token**, you can use local models or a remote API.

---

## 7. Adaptive Crawling (New!)

Crawl4AI now includes intelligent adaptive crawling that automatically determines when sufficient information has been gathered. Here's a quick example:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, AdaptiveCrawler

async def adaptive_example():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        adaptive = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler)

        # Start adaptive crawling
        result = await adaptive.digest(
            start_url="
            query="async context managers"
        )

        # View results
        adaptive.print_stats()
        print(f"Crawled {len(result.crawled_urls)} pages")
        print(f"Achieved {adaptive.confidence:.0%} confidence")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(adaptive_example())
Copy
```

**What's special about adaptive crawling?**
- **Automatic stopping**: Stops when sufficient information is gathered
- **Intelligent link selection**: Follows only relevant links
- **Confidence scoring**: Know how complete your information is

[Learn more about Adaptive Crawling →](../adaptive-crawling/)

---

## 8. Multi-URL Concurrency (Preview)

If you need to crawl multiple URLs in **parallel**, you can use `arun_many()`. By default, Crawl4AI employs a **MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher**, automatically adjusting concurrency based on system resources. Here’s a quick glimpse:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def quick_parallel_example():
    urls = [
        "
        "
        "
    ]

    run_conf = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        stream=True  # Enable streaming mode
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        # Stream results as they complete
        async for result in await crawler.arun_many(urls, config=run_conf):
            if result.success:
                print(f"[OK] {result.url}, length: {len(result.markdown.raw_markdown)}")
            else:
                print(f"[ERROR] {result.url} => {result.error_message}")

        # Or get all results at once (default behavior)
        run_conf = run_conf.clone(stream=False)
        results = await crawler.arun_many(urls, config=run_conf)
        for res in results:
            if res.success:
                print(f"[OK] {res.url}, length: {len(res.markdown.raw_markdown)}")
            else:
                print(f"[ERROR] {res.url} => {res.error_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(quick_parallel_example())
Copy
```

The example above shows two ways to handle multiple URLs:
1. **Streaming mode** (`stream=True`): Process results as they become available using `async for`
2. **Batch mode** (`stream=False`): Wait for all results to complete

For more advanced concurrency (e.g., a **semaphore-based** approach, **adaptive memory usage throttling**, or customized rate limiting), see [Advanced Multi-URL Crawling](../../advanced/multi-url-crawling/).

---

## 8. Dynamic Content Example

Some sites require multiple “page clicks” or dynamic JavaScript updates. Below is an example showing how to **click** a “Next Page” button and wait for new commits to load on GitHub, using **`BrowserConfig`** and **`CrawlerRunConfig`**:

```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode
from crawl4ai import JsonCssExtractionStrategy

async def extract_structured_data_using_css_extractor():
    print("\n--- Using JsonCssExtractionStrategy for Fast Structured Output ---")
    schema = {
        "name": "KidoCode Courses",
        "baseSelector": "section.charge-methodology .w-tab-content > div",
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "section_title",
                "selector": "h3.heading-50",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "section_description",
                "selector": ".charge-content",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "course_name",
                "selector": ".text-block-93",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "course_description",
                "selector": ".course-content-text",
                "type": "text",
            },
            {
                "name": "course_icon",
                "selector": ".image-92",
                "type": "attribute",
                "attribute": "src",
            },
        ],
    }

    browser_config = BrowserConfig(headless=True, java_script_enabled=True)

    js_click_tabs = """
    (async () => {
        const tabs = document.querySelectorAll("section.charge-methodology .tabs-menu-3 > div");
        for(let tab of tabs) {
            tab.scrollIntoView();
            tab.click();
            await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 500));
        }
    })();
    """

    crawler_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
        extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema),
        js_code=[js_click_tabs],
    )

    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url=" config=crawler_config
        )

        companies = json.loads(result.extracted_content)
        print(f"Successfully extracted {len(companies)} companies")
        print(json.dumps(companies[0], indent=2))

async def main():
    await extract_structured_data_using_css_extractor()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Copy
```

**Key Points**:

* **`BrowserConfig(headless=False)`**: We want to watch it click “Next Page.”
* **`CrawlerRunConfig(...)`**: We specify the extraction strategy, pass `session_id` to reuse the same page.
* **`js_code`** and **`wait_for`** are used for subsequent pages (`page > 0`) to click the “Next” button and wait for new commits to load.
* **`js_only=True`** indicates we’re not re-navigating but continuing the existing session.
* Finally, we call `kill_session()` to clean up the page and browser session.

---

## 9. Next Steps

Congratulations! You have:

1. Performed a basic crawl and printed Markdown.
2. Used **content filters** with a markdown generator.
3. Extracted JSON via **CSS** or **LLM** strategies.
4. Handled **dynamic** pages with JavaScript triggers.

If you’re ready for more, check out:

* **Installation**: A deeper dive into advanced installs, Docker usage (experimental), or optional dependencies.
* **Hooks & Auth**: Learn how to run custom JavaScript or handle logins with cookies, local storage, etc.
* **Deployment**: Explore ephemeral testing in Docker or plan for the upcoming stable Docker release.
* **Browser Management**: Delve into user simulation, stealth modes, and concurrency best practices.

Crawl4AI is a powerful, flexible tool. Enjoy building out your scrapers, data pipelines, or AI-driven extraction flows. Happy crawling!

ALWAYS provide which page they should visit to find the exact information they are looking for, if possible, by saying 'Please visit [page URL] for the full details.' If you cite information from a source, always include the full URL shown in the source.If no answer is found, summarize anything related, and politely inform the user that the answer does not appear to be present, suggest a related page by URL if present in the content. Do not hallucinate.At the end, write 'SUFFICIENT: YES' if the answer fully resolves the question, or 'SUFFICIENT: NO' if not. Write 'CONFIDENCE: <0-100>%, based on how confident you are that this answers the question fully'. Write 'Full info or more info: <URL>'

Using only the current webpage content below, answer the user's question by quoting the relevant passage, code block, or table WORD-FOR-WORD, including ALL formatting, indentation, and line breaks. DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or shorten ANY part of the quoted answer, unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize giving the most detailed answer possible by quoting the all relevant text from the content. If the content has numbers, prices, code, tables, or other specific details, quote them exactly as they appear. If multiple relevant passages are found, include ALL of them in their entirety, word-for-word. ALWAYS provide which page they should visit to find the exact information they are looking for, if possible, by saying 'Please visit [page URL] for the full details.' If you cite information from a source, always include the full URL shown in the source.If no answer is found, summarize anything related, and politely inform the user that the answer does not appear to be present, suggest a related page by URL if present in the content. Do not hallucinate.At the end, write 'SUFFICIENT: YES' if the answer fully resolves the question, or 'SUFFICIENT: NO' if not. Write 'CONFIDENCE: <0-100>%, based on how confident you are that this answers the question fully'. Write 'Full info or more info: <URL>'

FaZe 2 -0

is this 2018

NO ITS 2022

GET SMARTER

Hello....... how r u. Boooooooooo 2:0

hopefully c9 can upset Faze

CSGO yes

honestly FaZe has the potential to 13-0 Clown 9 here 😬

Get that faze flair off plz

obvious bait bud

No shit lmao its just cringe

No shit lmao its just cringe - cringe

No shit lmao its just cringe - cringe  
~cringe

**C9 2-1 Faze**

battle of the ages

C9 2-0 Faze. C9 is a diff beast I feel like. Their 3-0 loss to The Guard would have fueled them so much

Reaction?

I was walking on the streets and suddenly I saw all the Cloud9 players soaked wet on such a hot and sunny day. I went near them and asked why they are wet when it was not raining. They replied, "We are so washed that not even the sun could dry us." I felt sorry for them and gave them my handkerchief and walked away.

C9 2-0

BOSTON MAJOR

REVENGE MATCH PRAYGE

Boston Major MonkaW

FAZE 2-0! REVENGE MATCH for Niko!

Is Tarik playing guys?

Tarik is still in turkey so they're subbing in leaf

We haven't seen curry in action yet with C9 and I think FaZe really does have a good chance but im still taking C9

C9 2-1 FaZe

curry played with c9 vs optic last week.

ye i posted it before the optic game

C9 ez after that performance against optic

C9 2-0

boston

C9 2-1, Curry meshing better with the team

I want to see an upset.  
Leaf has an off day and Babybay and Dicey go giga stupid hard. Faze 2-1

C9B 2-0

FaZe 2-0 no sweat ezaf

C9 2-1

14-16  
16-10  
22-19

Surely Cloud9 wins this one, right?

OMEGALUL

Wait Poach is back?

No

C9 2-1 Faze

Dicey & babybay will take 1 map

Don’t let this match distract you from the fact that FaZe Clan choked a 15-11 lead in the CS:GO Boston Major Final on the final map, Inferno, giving C9 and NA their first Major.

C9 2-0

Who's gonna win???

yk I might just be delusional but I think that FaZe will either get 13-0'd both maps or somehow win 2-1

I agree wid u. There is no in between for this team

C9 2-0

FaZe 2-1 no sweat

faze justifying benching poach for flyuh

poach wasn't even that good I don't know why vlr was crying when he benched

fortnite kids

me when even vlr thought c9 would win that round

might be upset weekend idk  
first 100t and XSET now this

Boston major revenged. No niko no tilt confirmed 💀

SENTINELS MIRACLE RUNNNNNNN

even if sentinels beats c9 13-0 on both maps they still lose due to being -27 in the bracket

flyuh diff

HOLYYYY

there's no beating quandale come on fam

Big D icey diffed 1Leaf

T1 reject diff

no xeta, no meta

curry curse

oh nawr, here comes all the best analysts of vlr/gg where confirmation bias is their only way of reasoning ans logic

Lmao 🤣 told u that without xeta c9 mess up their synergy. Xeta is a great support player that knows how to set up utility for c9 players to shine.

so C9 without korean buff is not that great

100t 2-1 sentinels COPIUM

TSM 2-0 SEN\*\*

The copium

well Sen cudnt make it lmao

lmao

Sentinels 2-1

T1 vs TSM OMEGA MEGA ULTIMA UNIVERSAL BILLION YEARS HOPIUM

EASY FOR SENTINELS

SENTINELS VS TSM FOR OLD TIMES SAKE

I would cream my pants. We are just two games away from this

TSM 2-1 Sen.

Dude, actually easy bracket for SEN. They are dog shit if they lose.

The other bracket has NRG, V1, Ghost Gaming, Evil Geniuses, Dark Zero, and Knights.

Bro, sen lost 💀

LMAOO, yeah dogshit actually.

100t 2-1 faze really close games. Dicey pops up big time.

TSM 2-0 Faze

TSM SEN HOPIUM

banger

.

Tsm 2-0 not even close

Revive the rivalry, bring back the memes, get ready for showdown. It’s TSM v SEN. #TSMWIN

FAZE VS LG  
IG FAZE 2-1 CLOSE FKING GAMES

TSM 2-1 FAZE

rip that we couldnt get a sen vs tsm matchup

damnnnnnn check out that matchup history, another stomp for TSM to qualify for Stage 2 Groups. Never thought I'd be saying that. hoping wardell can close it out against NRG as a sub, too bad he'll be done subbing before the group stage.

This entire bracket has been defying matchup history my guy, I think this will probably be one of the best sets to watch this entire bracket and it will be a good one. I don't think anyone really thought this would happen and it's cool to see it did.

If faze win this, they will break two head-to-head losing streaks in a day. LFG

FaZe wins rematch

FaZe 2-1 please

TSM this close to be 7-0 against FaZe

It will be so funny if tsm actually win this

XSET Female would body both these teams tbh

unfortunately

WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE

uh oh its TSM

XSET Female > both these teams

TSM 2-1

TSM 2-1  
#TSMWIN

6-0 head to head ???  
Surely tsm win this right?

Both these teams qualify this challengers, whoever wins quals and whoever loses wins the lowers and quals

One of TSM, FaZe makes close. Let that sink in.

They both deserve it? They beat 100T and SEN who are considered t1 lmao

Yeah they totally deserve it. it's just they haven't been looking this good in a long time.

True, both teams struggled last year, to see them making a comeback is nice

faze 26-0 unless gmd go luck mode then mby 26-12

are u gonna continue to meatride gmd or what cause TSM 2-0

The fact that these two teams are the ones qualifying, even if they deserve it, blows my mind. 2 teams that were basically in the T2 purgatory finally getting over the hump

Still in the T2 category IMO.

What is T1 for u? Curious to know

a tier, not a team lmao.

Fair enough

like v1

FAZE 2-0

7 vs dicey  
(ex 100T, same role)

This is the closest TSM has been to the playoffs since 2020.

VAMOS 7 💪

2-1 for TSM

TSM 2-0 In my book.

Is this tsm strat ? Always slow start

Judging from the map picks. I am gonna say Faze wins Ascent, TSM wins Icebox and Faze wins Haven.

Damn, I am rarely wrong with my predictions. I should consider betting.

Watching TSM play gets me tilted, so yeah. Ain't watching it lol

Any movies recommendation?

Grown ups is always fun. Dont breathe is fun

Bee movie

Faze Stocks might be down irl rn but I'm putting all my eggs on this Faze win lets go Dicey

LFG first map Faze won against TSM this year. Let's hope they don't get complacent though. TSM is a pretty good comeback team

All good guys tsm always lose their map 1

Only babybay and dicey have good mechanical skills.  
Remaining 3 are bad

Yeah..you can argue that

Prayge

Im not suprised if TSM FTX Corey AKA Aimbot abuser seven AKA Crackhead, and Subroza AKA IglRoza Will bring TSm to the dub

##TSMWIN

Babybay makes me to use that vandal skin

nice. Babybay's decision-making seems to have gotten so much better. It's not just run it down smeaging it's like calculated chaos and smart decision making when taking fights and in repositioning.

it is lol.

wait for him to play tier 1 teams. his pushes will make him look stupid. But yeah, he improved a lot because his pushes wouldn't even work against top tier 2s, now it works :)

just not against tier 1 yet

please just time out faze before yall lose the lead  
literally just chill the lurks don't have to go first, especially when it's the astra

Hmmmm  
Faze follow ur advice!

supabot:(

supamen what doink bro

GG Saj

Wow what a match hope Tsm can qualify

That dicey 3k on 11-12..... ICE IN HIS VEINS

Gave me first strike memories no cap

TSM threw that round so badly lmao

holy fucking shit, props to faze, possible 100t vs TSM rematch

Ez for tsm then

Corey and friends

Didn’t your team lose 3-0 to optic?

Has your team ever made it to challengers top 4?

optic got lucky they suck

SEN fan spotted

dicey save the day

Dicey IS SO FUCKIN GOOOOOOD

Dicey brother I love you.

babybay and dicey crazy af

imagine how scary faze will be when supamen is in his LCQ form

Actually cant wait for him to be back in form, faze will be top 5 NA easily

supamen pls come back to 2021 form

FaZe 2 -0

dont even give me anything to cheer for anymore SEN...

JK SEN 2-0 LMFAO..... copium 😔

I support sentinels

How is this comment +11 there is no way sen is winning  
Maybe with sick but not possible with no coach and a sub

Coach is the sub. I think they made a big brain move. Ez win for sen

Thats copium as a sen fan now I've actually ran out of copium

I hope we win

SEN 2-0 COPIUM

Faze 2-0 Sen

YES SENTINELS SO BAD

FAZE 2-0 SEN

If the SEN plays like they were playing in the end of the open qualifiers then they could beat em 2-1 otherwise no

**FAZE 2-1 SEN**

FAZE 2-0

Sen 2-0

now uhm... not too sure LMFAO

Not quite sure.

you misspelled 0-2

SEN 2-0

SEN 2-0

Smeag diffs Tenzedzombie

SEN 2-1 FaZe  
obv faze can win this again will not be suprised if they do but i just got a gut feeling sen will close it out

2 washed teams

sen 2-1

Sentinels 0 5 run incoming

SEN have a slight chance here imo

sen lose 2-0

sen needs this win and the one against c9 to qual. assuming that c9 lose against lg as well. sen hopium

doesn't matter, SEN just needs to win the next 2 and they qualify, other teams winning doesn't matter as SEN will win in head to head

SEN lose 0-2

sen 2-1

Sen 2-1 , hopium mode on

SEN 2-1 FAZE  
TENZ WILL CARRY IT  
FAZE GO BACK TO HOME  
GL HF

SEN 2-0

Tenz becomes the Goat on Chamber and Yoru

SEN 2-0 Faze EZ

Sen fans still coping? LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Nothing wrong with that

EZ game for Faze clean 2-0

LLL

SEN 2-1

Faze wipe this washed team

Manbay gonna diff TenL

Surely FaZe Clan won't lose this, right?

Stop

Babybay going to diff TenZ hard.

Faze 2-0

13-8  
13-10

FAZE UP

SEN 2-0

tenz and friends 2-1 faze

FaZe 2-1 SEN

SEN 2-0 FAZE ONLY IF DADDY TENZ IS PLAYING TO DIFF BABYBAY

both teams that require their main characters to pop off  
sen hopium + copium = sen 2-0 faze  
fr tho this'll be a banger match

"IF" SEN has been practicing and preparing new comps & strats (like how Shazam said on his stream), then they COULD win against FaZe

Faze 2-0 SEN  
edit: wtf I forgot i posted here and made another pred

If Ben Ten and Sick play, SEN 2-0 Faze.

is sen out yet or can they still qualify?

they are out

They can qualify just some specific things have to happen

They can qualify if they win both their games and faze and cloud9 lose all the rest of their games.

FaZe 2-0 SEN #FaZeUp

SEN needs this :(

Faze 2-0

Is Tenz back, official?

Even tho their chances to win are slim I still stick with sentinels SEN 2-0 Faze let's just pray

Sen 2-0 with rawkass

Faze 2-0 sen  
They were already out of form nd the current replacement of rawkus and zero practice they ain't got no chance

Still a Sen supporter tho👍

Faze easy 2-0

Cant wait to see some more Babybay Neon

HAHAHAHA THAT X5 ODDS ON SEN xD

Faze Up ♥

FaZe 2-1  
(Rawkus will give SEN a buff)

what happen to sick?

Family problems. Rawkus Subbing in. Rawkus is a great player though. used to play for faze. not that the faze roster is the same when rawkus played. Faze 2-1 here though. SEN need some time off/time to practice more/a change in roster. 2023 is the last chance for SEN in valorant. if 2023 goes bad... well, no more sentinels valorant.

or at least not valorant anyone will watch anymore. I think if SEN have a bad 2023... the roster breaks up completely.

yeah it's gonna be hard for them to qualify on their current state and the fact that it's sick (one of their best player)

Faze 2-0  
13-9  
14-12

Sentinels win 2-1

Can we expect sen tenz to play chamber? 0\_0

Clash of Washed Teams

Faze 2-0 ez match

Paper rex 2-0 Sen ...oh wait

Tenz drops 50 map 1, rawkus drops 50 map 2.

drop tenz and rawkus on the team 👍

LUL u went too far with the rawkus one

SEN 2-0 13-0 both maps rawkus gets 100 kills ez.

SEN 2-1

Copium

Lets hop in sentinel's trian hopium today.

Choo choo

if tenz is on chamber and kanpeki on secondary duelist i think we win this

شخصية البطل

SEN 2-1 hopium 😞

sen 2-1 troll

Sen 2-1 but every game goes into ot

idk what will be the outcome but sentinel's gameplay has degraded since that g2 match. all the players except tenz have been almost not been able to play properly, there agent choice is very predictable nowadays and other plays almost know how they are playing and are better at the aim duels. I read a comment which was like a harsh truth for me -"they were good only when the game was fresh and when others probably didn't know how to compete at pro level in valorant." i just don't know why but I feel like everybody expects so much from tenz. i know that he is prodigy but the depends too much on him. and the only improvement i have seen is in dapr. anyways hope they win this match

should we celebrate

Sen 2-1 HOPIUM

SEN 2-1 HOPIUM

Sen 2-1 HOPIUM

Sen 3-2 copium

Is there any chance for SEN to qualify?

Yes if they win against faze today and against c9 next week they have a chance of making it to playoffs as the 4th and last seed, but even then its not 100%.

c9 and faze also have to lose their next matches against whoever their playing

ok

dicey diff

Not a clean map but we move

I guess Tenz wanted to be like Forsaken

damn FaZe are not very good

Its actually sad how Shaz fan’t even get a right timing to get a descent 2k

i cant believe its actually 12;12

12;7 12;12, fuk off senitels honestly

tenz dogshit

Sentinels just a fucking troll team I guess

12-7 to 14-12 lmfao

shazam absolute brainless bum haaha ezzz babybaay bye doooggos

gg

YIKES

11-5 to 14-16... The way SEN ended their valorant career

gg

I guess Sen is going 0 to 5 now on how they performed on last map. What a dogshit team

HOW CAN THEY LOSE THAT!!!!!

Let's stop hating on SEN and appreciate that both babybay & dicey just dropped +50K in 2 maps

Totally. Dicey is having quite the redemption ark since being dropped from 100T.

The godly duo showed up today

streamer vs player holy shit

Free C site+0 head retake

sen kinda threw a huge advantage on haven but overall they played very well all things considered. on the other hand though BABYBAY HOLY SHIT

I want to be a Sentinels player, I'm bad as fuck too

You can join VK

feels bad man :( everyone on SEN played very well last map. GGs to Faze they played amazing, that b push on attack was so strong man really well played by Faze and I loved how they kept branching from B pushes to c or even back a they really exploited SENs lack of ability to counter that attack on B. GGs!

Can sentineles qualify if they beast C9 and FaZe loses their next match or is there like no way?

wdym? sen went 0-4 there's no chance for them lmao

Valorant : how many lose you want?  
Sentinels : YES

Just retire and go full time streamer lol

Not too bad with a sub. NT Sen. Good bye

shaz is the biggest L in the entire valorant scene

Faze were not even trying lol & Sen lost 2-0. If they tried don't know what would have happened. Maybe 13-0?

TenZ becoming next shroud, Stream only no pro matches

ez for white paper rex

SEN in the mud, love to see it

LG 2-0

FaZe 2-0 LG

Faze 2-0. Babybay drops 50 first map. Dicey drops 50 on the second one.

LG 2-1

FAZE 2-0 EZ

FAZE 0-2 ^

LG will win this 2v5 quite easily

Lg 2-1

Ffs

LG 2-0

Flyuh throws and the team gets destroyed

Lg 2-1 justice for poach

LG 2-1

How do the odds switch to faze after a roster move

probably the same odds . poach doesn't seem like he contributes much when hes not igling

No I mean the odds switched from lg is favoured to faze is favoured after the move. but ig not anymore it's 50/50 now for some reason

finally a good take on this site

Faze 2-0 LG

LG 2-1 Faze

faze 2-1

gg bdog is awake

faze should have an easy time on attack vs lg 0 defense

Yeah, faze will take it on attack.

yup thought lg had a good ct out of nowhere, but seemed like they just lucked into the game. atleast faze won

dazzle threw the game there for LG, ez faze m1 ty <3 13-11 FaZeUP

What?

What a round, poised IGL diff

Holy fuck now Dazzle is 5head

I'm surprised this game was 50-50 from the start when LG clearly showing good performances lately

poach smiling in his bed watching faze fall down

how are faze losing to the worst icebox team na Sadge

POACH died for this

gg close game they're just better

History tells us that Optic plays badly in the first game. Faze might 2-1 Optic if that happens but if not then Optic 2-1 Faze

aged like milk. Optic ain't never playing bad in the first game again curse broken. #GREENWALL

**OG 2-1 FAZE**

(*if OG wouldn't stop dicey+babybay duo it could go 2-1/2-0 in favour of Faze*)

"OG 2-1 unless faze win then Faze 2-1 or 2-0"  
?? dude you literally just said either OG win or Faze win

He's just saying he thinks its gonna be a close game that can go either way

Thank u for explaining. Things can get confusing. 👍

OPTIC 2-0

Faze 2-0 Optic  
the smeag gives El diablo diarrhoea via 5g waves and optic have to ff

2-1 Optic

Babybay has a history of smeaging over the best players in the region and it's shown time and time again that you can't stop him by trying to get your star duelist to fight him. He's smeaged over Tenz, Asuna, Corey and Yay before. Yay has also had trouble slowing down and stopping Sayaplayer. Something about OW duelists hits different.

The way you stop Babybay is by cutting him off from his support line and surviving the first engagement. Optic is the best team at fighting a man down and Faze is known to throw rounds when they have the advantage. Marved also knows exactly how Babybay plays. Faze is going to lose some crucial eco rounds, fuck their economy and slowly lose. Babybay stats won't be impressive because of that and people will blame him because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

Time for Faze to get exposed.

FAZE 2-0 POACH DROPS 50 MAP 1

OPTIC 2-0. I think it will take more than the Dicey and Babybay duo to convince me that they will win against Optic.

optic go ein

OpTic 2-0

Smeag diffs L diablo

OpTic 2-1

Classic COD rivalry, very excited for this game

I’m sure all players and coaches watched the matches yesterday, 100T wasn’t messing around pulling out some nice tricks and post plants I wouldn’t be surprised if teams playing today open up their playbooks a bit more. This match is gonna be close and a good insight in how that fast play from faze is going effect some maybe more solid set pieces. I think crashies comes up huge, 2-1 optic

OpTic haven't faced a real team like FaZe since their Envy days against Sentinels. FaZe 2-0 on the backs of NA's best jett player

FaZe 2-0 yay and friends

Do people really have faze winning this?

Some do but I dont, Optic are legit the best team in the world theres no shot we win(jinxing them)

Lol. Good luck to both teams. I think Faze is very good. Hoping for new comp and good match.

2-0 optic

OPTC 2-1 FAZE I wouldnt be suprised if optic lose this one because Rise beat optic on the last first group stage. Happy about any of these teams winning.

the old cod pro league rivalry throwback is gonna make for an interesting valorant match

faze 2-1 optic

I'm kinda scared for faze in the fact that maybe what happened to nrg last stage might happen to them this stage. They're a good team that can make playoffs but going against the best teams in the group early and maybe getting stomped might just remove their confidence and just not let them build any momentum. Just unlucky scheduling u know?

told y'all that babybay's aggressive tactics would fold under good players lol.

Dude Yay and Marved. Also the util use is great from Optic

This is what happens when a good team constantly plays against different styles in international competition. You can see how much optic has learned, improved and literally perfected gameplay. They're slowly growing into maybe a league of legends-ike team that can integrate different comps and adjust while learning new metas fast asf.

I really like how OpTic utilize Neon wall.

Marved so cold🥶

i want optic x loud again

Just to lose again

ok

#freedicey

PRX 🤝 liquid 🤝OpTic

Cringe comps

yay is something else!

Let Victor get used to using Neon and disrupting enemy's space then it will be a pain in the ass for other teams to play against this comp lol.

Optic is on a whole another level

try to beat the cringe.i dare u

lets goo over21.5

finally optic fighting and beating a real team

Marved will be the first one I make fun of when OpTic falls off. That guy tbagging just like Dapr, cocky as fuck.

Cope harder

you're broke + bad + he's a Masters champion LMFAO

You're from Turkey lmao. I'll slap you just like the turkey meat lmaoooo.

? actually braindead

HAHAHAHAHA

cry harder

Faze doing pretty good for a new roster honestly, but overall game as expected Optic does what we thought they would , 2-0

#FaZeDown

Optic is like Bard, above the expectation

wow

optic suffering against faze  
didnt expect that tbh

i know domestic matchups are not good to see the team's level but still....

I didn't see optic suffering. It looked pretty easy for them.

hmmm not sure?

didnt watch the game but optic won 4/4 pistols and score were close still, means they were worse on full buy rounds

I watch the game and they are trolling

what in the retard

Ur a robot no?

He's a Brazil fan of course he's hating on Optic, Loud got stomped on

Faze did good against a team considered the best in NA, unlucky that they're the first team we have to face. New roster shaping up good so far

Dicey and friends

Sheesh yay

dz 2-1

Yes there’s a stream!

i would love to see dark zero pull a win here i think it would be cool seeing them against xset

against insight\*

we really do just love watching the world burn ig

Only this match being officially streamed lmao.

they stated they have no staff because of some holday weekend shit or something like that

"Unlucky Really"

no one cares about faze. also scam org and owners and yet riot still stream their game what a joke

So this is how the self-proclaimed "#1 Jett NA" plays.

Let's see if BabyBay can bail his team out.

Almost

Faze DeeZ Nuts

LMAAAAAAAAAO

Deeznuts

people were hating on me when i called faze a fluke after their mickey mouse masters 1 run... where are all those "SmEaG" fanboys now?

slime slats 2-0 faze clan #slimeslatstothemoon

ez for 🐍$lime🐍$slatt$🐍

Faze is back😈

I would love this to be the case. Like I completely understand the level of teams they were playing isn’t top tier, but only giving up 6 rounds in 4 maps has to be a big confidence booster for the team.

If Faze can get back into the NA scene where the teams that beat them for months were only SEN and V1, the Top 5 in NA will become even more interesting. And the fight to Berlin all the more exciting.

monkaS

FaZe not looking good, LOL.

Faze are awful.... even if they go on to win that is pathetic

The demons MonkaW

so faze is going to be out and we can't even watch it grr

#FuckBabyJ

dumbass

Faze so washed up

haha c9b almost lost to orgless haha

Bro? Ur a tsm fan..

lmao

Kekw let’s see the the males can finish it

Faze are literally what TSM is gonna be if the dont change their whole roster by tomorrow  
Lol tsm struggled and got out aimed by a tier 3 team

0/8 bait nt

haha 100t struggled harder.

Outaimed in what game?

Also before people get too over board it’s literally only one map and also frail males are not some randoms, everyone on that team is good

How are they good?? Cuz they are radiants? Lmao

The fact that their players can match Faze mechanically makes it harder for them to just smeag past this game unlike most open bracket games

C9 2-0 G2  
Group stage merchant strikes again. Though winning this will mean nothing as C9 will still go 0-4 in playoffs, losing to 000thieves and 2 game esports to close the year out.

G2 2-0 C9  
26-0  
jawgemo drops 50.

c9 wins if this game qualifies them to playoffs

they lose if they're already qualified/if they can't make it anymore

G2 2-0

C9 26-0

C9's 0-5 journey starts here

G2 26-0

can C9 finally win vs G2

CLOUD 9 THRUST A TIGHT WIN FROM THE JAWS OF DEFEAT

C9 go onstage worried and scared, they get bent over throughout map 1, aside from a few hero plays, C9 is a trainwreck, but in map 2, the bald light of immi's head reinvigorates C9, and the next game, my glorious king xeppaa loses 20kg, and plays the best hes ever played, Mitch's IGL is horrendous and usual but Xeppaa goes god mode and C9 is able to wrench map 2 from G2. In the final map, a C9 fan throws a brick at leaf's round ass head, knocking him clean out, and because there was already a tech pause for 3 hours in the last map, the game continues, and G2 without their hard carry, is as good as 2g. GG EZ, c9 win in a clean 2-1 series where they lay significant pipe into G2's behind

C9 2-1 G2

This Guy has all Scripts Written for all League Matches, But His Story Ends once team enters into Playoffs

"this guy" also hacked into riot headquaters to get the official vct script and he simply shares its contents with the ungrateful, they called jesus a false prophet too. so be careful buddy cause I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.

and You are 16 yrs Old

will be rooting for G2 for the first ever time since they need to win this for 2G to have a chance at making playoffs… any tips from G2 fans (if you exist)

You might go cross eyed but keep an eye on the minimap if you wanna enjoy the macro. Sliggy co-streams are great for it too!

C9 ban Ascent, G2 ban Sunset, C9 pick Bind, G2 pick Lotus, C9 ban Icebox, G2 ban Haven, Corrode Remains.

G2 win Bind 13-11  
G2 win Lotus 13-8

G2 win 2-0

Looks fair

1/7 holy shit im buns

C9 2-0  
Easy for v1c

Is leaf going to play in this game?

Doesn't matter simple IGL diff

If leaf plays 2-0 if not 2-1

*winning this match for g2 means they are gonna play 100 thieves, losing means they get leviathan.. interesting . . .*

C9 2-0  
Oxy clears

only plays well vs shit teams, turns into dambi vs teams that shoot back

Dambi is not bad lol

didnt say he was bad, hes just mid

Isn’t this game basically meaningless for playoffs

Not gonna lie, this map prediction is ass. Doubt G2 or C9 will ban Sunset

maps should be Haven Ascent decider Sunset C9 will not play Lotus on G2 lol

lmao

it's tough out here bro

Sorry c9, you have no chance  
G2-0

G2 Win

leaf is back so this mean's G2 win clean. joever for oxy

wait babybay still in game, g2 might lose

I hope Babybay plays this game! Let Leaf keep resting!

Americas is sad because every game with G2 and sen Against anyone else is a forgone conclusion

caster is cooking

C9 is the definition of mid

G2 2-0 Cloud9

BABYBAY MASTERCLASS

free for g2  
oxy diasterclass as always against real team

Bro got the most kills in the match

babyyay too so what?  
what i said its a straight fact

ummmm....

He had the most kills in the match and went +4 in first bloods, highest ACS, Highest Rating.

that's far from a disaterclass lol

Cloud9 2-1 Win MVP:v1c

this region is abysmal man how is a caster running train on you like that

net is fns in disguise

Babybay my goat

this is exactly why they said APAC is the most entertaining league. prime group stage c9 isn't fighting back against G2 with a sub

Holy, Babybay on top!

when minus immi?

Not before - xeppa - Mitch, but all immediately after they bomb out of playoffs

Immi is a good coach

BABYBAY TOP FRAG?

Jawg has 6 more

In map 1 at least.

Omfg. Smeag BABYBAY!

losing against a sub topfragging is just embarrassing. this region is a joke

jawgemo is not a sub tho

oh in map 1 ok

it just shows Americas has more talent than other regions

SAVE OXY

Lev will be here

You misspelt Leaf bro I gotchu

LMAO

not so easy to say that they misspelt Babybay

G2 2-0 100T

100T 26 - 0 G2

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA EZ WIN G2

close enough, but otherway round

100T should win a corrode so really should be G2-100T

Oh damn 😂

I cant wait for sunset and lotus just dont know map 3.

map 3?

Please fucking ban Lotus, it's all I ask

banning lotus aint gonna help you against g2 with king babybae lil bro

could have had first seed but here we are

TBD 2-0 100T

dude above me is the least obvious jinx

map pool:

100T A  
G2 B

100T ban Lotus, G2 ban Bind, 100T pick Corrode, G2 pick Ascent, 100T ban Haven, G2 ban Sunset, Icebox Remains

1/3

is leaf back

100T ban Lotus, G2 ban Bind, 100T pick Haven, G2 pick Ascent, 100T ban Sunset, G2 ban Icebox, Corrode Remains.

G2 win Haven 13-11  
G2 win Ascent 13-5

G2 win 2-0

100T needs a better map pool

BABYBAY DROPS A HUGE SHIT ALL OVER100T

26-19

Imagine if Leaf is still not back and they take Babybay all the way through the playoffs and win Stage 2 with him

Honestly its possible.. Babybay isnt even all that bad they 2-0'd C9 and babybay was mvp so.

100T win condition is picking into Bind and Corrode somehow:  
give asuna his adderall.  
and just to turn up on the day.  
Statistically 100Ts Bind has always been good, their corrode looked alr too

I'm more hopeful for a lower bracket run

Bind is G2's perma ban

The only chance 100T has is if G2 just want to practice their Bind for Champs so they don't ban it since they are already qualified but I doubt it

we're so cooked

Even though G2 is better 100T can win this. G2 is saving strats and don't care anymore.

100t pls win so it becomes easy for NRG

<

100T 2-0

100T 2-1

hi

100T either squeak it out or lose by a mile  
100T 2-1 Prayge

Gamers2 are getting exposed

Both can do the funniest thing (one by throwing, the other being kess becoming prime Von, halfway there alr)

This is, uh, gonna be... mm... well it's gonna be... something...

lotus or sunset is through so g2 already a map up

if babybay is cooking again this region is legitimately cooked

americas is already exposed bro

100 Thieves 2-1 Win MVP:eeiu

100T win.........................................................................................................................................................................I hope

burger league

If they lose to BabyBay I quit

“pros don’t fake”  
checks out considering valyn sucks

zander always the first one to die dafq

Have you checked the stats? Asuna 12 FD

Asuna does nothing for this team

getting bullied by a caster

Nice map pick 100T

The pecking order  
G2  
JoshRT  
Babybay's chair  
The worms inside the dirt  
The dirt  
100t

(Its not an insult, its a reference, dbza episode 6)

FaZe smeagul is back

Maptrade 11111100000203030%

Shocked that babybay is the highest rated player

BABYBAY FIRST MATCH MVP LETS GO MY GOAT

who needs leaf when you have BABYBAY  
chron's disease? more like CHRONIC SUPREMACY

Can't wait for the "it wasn't our day" tweet followed by the "we will try harder next time" and ultimately the "we will get them next season." Love the competitive spirit 100 Thieves.

Thank god we live in an influencer era that doesn't really give a crap about accountability or winning.

5 years of assuna just to get owned by a caster sub btw

Thrifty

this make FURIA and 2G look better

BABYBAY

BABYBAY... 30 years old bro back to business showing them kids how it's done. 😈

Hydrogen bomb vs Coughing baby

lets go babybay

Could have been an email.

BABYGOAT

26-9 is crazy

I’m surprised they even got 9 that was awful

Asuna 1/12 FK/FD is BRUTAL

assuna

asunyan should go vtubing

JoshRT gave 100t way too much respect in the mid-map interview.

Playoffs but stomp fiesta🥀💔

Well, that was certainly... a match.

babybay putting better numbers than some tier 1 players is crazy

Babybay is tier 1 he got done dirty on faze

babybay is getting comfortable lmfao

time to kick asuna

Close game

aint no way there are no americas teams that could win against G2 except SEN...

30 year old man fists 100paraplegics

and they say middle pack teams are closer to TOP teams (G2, SEN) lemau

Asuna the god of inconsistency.

100T when they can't play bind:

1.22 ods were telling u that there are some crazy lunatic thinks 100t can win against g2

asuna PLEASEEEEE I BELIEVED IN UUUU

FURIA 2-0

BABYBAY drops 50 and sends FURIA back to tier 6

BABYBAY drops 101 and makes FURIA quit franchising

furia have a chance if they drop urango or he starts shooting

bro was NOT a good fragger even in tier 2

ur mango

can FURIA win a map

Betting against G2 with a 100% guarantee

We getting 1.00 odds with this match 🗣🔥🔥

it is basically a 4v5, even insane players like heat cannot carry urango

i thought basic was on 2g

oh shit my bad

no basic moved to furia

basic played for 2G academy and then Furia picked him up but visa issues (riot small indie company moment)

honestly I’d rather stay in tier 2 than go to Furia

maybe furia puts up a fight like they just did in league

hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby ahh match

no tejo yes win

a furia surpreenderá e ganhará dessa farsa da g2

nem o basic salva mais, estou cansado chefe

KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

valorant speedrun

G26-0

G2 LETS BABYBAY TRY TO 1V5 EVERY ROUND AND HE DROPS 40 PER MAP  
G2 WIN 13-4 13-4

the question is: will f0ria get a round

G2 26-7 FUR

?????

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO

KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

How in the actual hell man

question is how many rounds will furia get?  
I'm saying 8, G2 26-8

Furia would be relegated out of tier 2

furia 2-0, urango drops 100

on paper g2 win

betting 13-0 on both maps if leaf is coming back

Apparently leaf is back well uhh Furia y'all have no chance at all..

The best Furia can do is 2-1. Teams like APK , Furia are only good for 1 map.

G2 can play w a silver and still win

Hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby

quick and easy FUR 2-0 G2, they don’t even stand a chance against the mighty urango 🔋❤️‍🩹🌹🌹

Betters are so stupid. they can’t understand this is the average storyline where the worst team comes together wins against the best in a 2-1 ot victory barley makes playoffs and then goes all the way to become champions. Furia valo champs of 2025. Trust in the process.

Babybae clears them.

If G2 doesn't ban Bind, we'll see bind.

If not, maps should be Lotus Haven and Corrode.

another 13-0? (puta q pariu, brasileiro so se fode nesse mundinho)

Urango MVP

They should kick heat for raafa and have urango and raafa co igl

Why would they kick their best player and bring in their worst player from the last stage? One of the monumental problems this team has is the lack of firepower; downgrading in this aspect would make the team even worse.

FUR ban Lotus, G2 ban Corrode, FUR pick Icebox, G2 pick Ascent, FUR ban Haven, G2 ban Sunset, Bind Remains.

G2 win Icebox 13-6  
G2 win Ascent 13-2

G2 win 2-0

This will be sad.

Close smh

nah this is where u gotta put 100 dolla on furia

Hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby

on EVERYONES SOUL furia 26-0

inb4 furia win

G2 trolls and 2-1 furia with 100-98 OT final map

2-0 g2 with bay getting signed permanently as backup

I Just bet my life savings agains FURIA. If G2 choke then i am done for

APK vs FNC americas version

poor tuyz bro experienced prime loud and now he has Urango as a IGL

It ain't happening but it would be so funny

A supernova vs a prokaryote

the big bang vs a sperm in a used condom

i was gonna comment "shit vs poop" but realised it was g2 and not 2g LOL

Why yhey took out adverso? Even I am better than Urango

Sure, buddy

You being ironic or not (i was kidding about me being better than Urango)?

leaf is back 🥶

baby bomb vs. coughing hydrogen

putting the house on FURIA, wish me luck ♥️

+1 homless person in NA

best match of all time incoming

furia about to be molested 🙏😭

G2 2:0

if furia wins I go bald

Its absolutely fascinating for constantly useless Furia is

Fúria should get relegated in the place of 2g

All part of the plan. Trust in the process.

AHAHAHAHAHA

Throw last 4v2(2v1) full info afk walk on side AhahahahahaAHAHAHAHAHAH

WHAT a do6s 322

why are you betting on furia respectfully. what did you expect

you get what you deserve

furia L

bro

Furia really have low game iq, why did he tap the bomb again at 2 seconds? Otherwise, Johnap would have peeked, and now he knows it was fake.

In 2 rounds on Ascent map, “Heat” fixed the result in round 15. I thought it was obvious, but in round 17, his fake was even more obvious.

Stop betting on Furia u dumb ass

Congrats furia being the worst team on franchise history!

G2 should pick Urango to IGL, instead leaf return

what a horrible team

Hey atleast it’s FURIA getting blown out not M80 or SRB right Riot?🤣🤣🤣 fucking joke of a company legit doing everything they can to minimize viewership bunch of zellsis words that can’t admit they were wrong when it comes to franchising

Heat is legit playing for stats. No help in retakes and doesn't even attempt at trading. Full baiting on viper and even on Chamber.

Feel bad for Palla as he's actually trying to play his role, but the others look like they're playing more for their VLR page.

G2 2-0 000thieves

g2 2-1 energy esports

every g2 player gets food poisoning for an NRG 2-0

NRG 2-1

this mf the biggest jinx ever

:)

i hope sen win 2-0 and win all of americas and then win champs :)))))

They are never going to win champs with this roster. Their only hope was last year with TenZ and Sacy.

Im not a religious person but please god nrg win

💔 all good we got lowers (99% faith 1% chance)

More like 99% chance 100% Faith NRG is stomping any team other than G2 n Sen

100T 2-1 NOT EVEN CLOSEE

100mid

This will be a banger game to watch hopefully

If i’m nrg, i’d just ff, group omega is cooked

Thank goodness you're not nrg

Yes, thank goodness I’m not a bum team

NRG 2-0 —> 13-4 13-3

lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Nrg 2-1 G2  
6 13  
13 11  
14 12

NRG 2-0 #s0mdiff

#s0mdiff

they dont got the energy(NRG) to beat the smeag

G2-0

G2 ban Corrode, NRG ban Sunset, G2 pick Ascent, NRG pick Lotus, G2 ban Bind, NRG ban Haven, Icebox Remains.

G2 win Ascent 13-8  
NRG win Lotus 14-12  
G2 win Icebox 13-8

G2 win 2-1.

It could be a way more dominant series from G2. NRG seems very dependent on momentum, and getting 1st seed might jeopardize that

How tf did you go 0-3 in map picks 😭

I underestimated how bad NRG's Ascent was

NRG 2-1 Skuba just diff

G2 2-1 NRG  
This is not gonna be easy, but Babybay & Co. are gonna do it.

NRG 2-1  
G2 is saving strats

NRG 2-0 13-0, 13-0  
BabyGOAT wont be able to carry these bums against serious team not named 100Frauds

Unc babybay >>>>>> Fraud brawk

actually gonna be a pretty good game i hope

this sh\*t cant be endless. NRG should break this caster's run

this si gonna be soooo gooooood

G2 wins with Babybay aren't impressive  
2G  
EG  
FURIA  
C9  
100T  
NRG winning this  
Thank me later

?

Did...did you not see babybay being better than 30% of pro players.....? I get the wins aren't against Paper Rex or EDG or something but.....did you even watch any of these games?

NRG 2-1 Win MVP:skuba

Ascent Haven Lotus. PLEASE

Nrg realy have chance

g2-0 Nrg is just a rebranded c9

SMEAG2-0 NRG

eth0n disasterclass incoming

G2 2-0 13-5 13-8

Mada disasterclass

Well at least I was right about mada being ssa

NRG 2-1, great map picks and bans

every team now copying jemkin waylay on corrode lol

Shit ass map

just look at g2s map bans, it will explain why they will lose this series

Let's go Nrg

Well thrown G2

xdddddddd 5v2 lose to s0m

Babyday hears 10 people in door and decides to stop watching it after tp. Straight up to lb

Babybay lowkey carrying g2

Mada jogando oq não jogou na fase grupos slk

NRG attack side bruhhh.... 🤦‍♂️

G2's best player is a 50 year old caster.

How can you lose to so many thrifty rounds in 1 map?

my eyes bleeding when i see this bronze plays on bind by nrg. losing to a team which dont play bind + standin. just disband xddd

G2 were rly good the whole time on bind what are you on about

Nah. BS NA valorant. Full of fixed games since yesterday. Yuck

0/8

G2 trying so hard even though they qualed💀

If NRG comebacks from this I'll be very impressed but G2 doesn't choke a lead like this right?

NRG looked like stage 2 winners for like one hour and now we are back to normal

nrg lost like 10 ecos this series XDDD 2-0 2-10 btw legit

THRIFTY AGAIN. HAHAHA NA VALORANT

Bro, this is FAZE BABYBAY! Smeag!!

what a clutch s0m

LESGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

ez for Faze karrigan

-20 sheesh that's my igl....wait

At least that was a nice 1v4

something something W stripper something something

NRG should’ve had Sunset. Bind was a G2 masterclass.

Damn. GGWP G2, let’s see if NRG’s mental is crushed

how is brawk even playing in tier 1 bro

because verno knocked fns out

4 games in a row now a caster owning these tier 1 teams, says a lot about the region

no one can beat my boys. even when trent is having the unluckiest series of his life, the champs prevail. 3peat incoming.

sen are about to have a field day against the frauds. mark my word lil bro

Sen barely beating fraud9😭✌🏻

g2 barely beating nrg lmfao

Babybay looks good now

Babybay the goat

I looked at the G2 bind comp and thought "WHAT THE F\*\*\* ARE WE DOING?????"

I was then stabbed 16 times in the right knee for doubting

That was like watching a Minecraft build montage. I know what's happening, I understand it, but I sure as hell can't replicate it

NA losing to 30yo caster lmfaoooo

Eg 2-1 g2 rematch.  
Yay learned his lesson and this time at 11-11 4 player up vs G2’s 2 players won’t dash onto site and lose

yay DEVOURS G2 and takes valyn's hairline to restore his own

u guys really think EG can defeat G2 ?  
I almost feel sorry for u guys

I feel like EG still has a very good chance no?  
I have no doubt in g2 but without leaf things get a lot harder for them.

G2 2-0  
BABYBAY DROPS 60.

yay threw the game 🙏🏼😭

yay threw the map holy

edit: never mind

by dropping 29 kills.\_. and getting 3 in the last round.

icy and supa carried

Carried a -18 together

CHAMBER DIFF (yay I know you’re the goat but pls stop ego peeking in clutch situations, had flashbacks to the Pearl incident)

el diablo

Icy is TERRIBLE

grass is green

actually?

el diablo knifed jawgemo lmfao

Evil Geniuses 2-1 Win MVP:supamen

And again Dumb2 with worst ascent attack ever  
They gonna lose this for sure

After my words they took 7 in a row  
Respectfully

yay uses ult on jett just to get knife out and walk with it  
insane IQ

and yeah paid actor potter with timeout pretending she knows anything about this game XD disband this team

Icy might be the worst tier 1 player currently

he's really bad but worst is so far from the truth. have you considered the entirety of furia? what about batujnax from apex. or perhaps zesbeew.

Furia shouldn't be considered tier 1

heat would 100-0 icy in a 1v1

heat the only good player on furia

urango?

damn jonahp you are like that?

icy is probably the worst player in franchise, i dont understand why potter picked him

she was the one who dropped the other guy for this bum

Urango disagree

G2 just had all the momentum. Corrode was their warmup lmfao

ggwp G2, EG i still love you

no way riot put ender and doug on the same cast lol 0 game knowledge incoming

bros yapping

Icy is such a fraud

Not again…

icy might be one of the worst to do it

bring back demon1

I'm stupid

Stay at home, yay.

Icy needs to go man

18/47 full bot

FaZe 2 -0

is this 2018

NO ITS 2022

GET SMARTER

Hello....... how r u. Boooooooooo 2:0

hopefully c9 can upset Faze

CSGO yes

honestly FaZe has the potential to 13-0 Clown 9 here 😬

Get that faze flair off plz

obvious bait bud

No shit lmao its just cringe

No shit lmao its just cringe - cringe

No shit lmao its just cringe - cringe  
~cringe

**C9 2-1 Faze**

battle of the ages

C9 2-0 Faze. C9 is a diff beast I feel like. Their 3-0 loss to The Guard would have fueled them so much

Reaction?

I was walking on the streets and suddenly I saw all the Cloud9 players soaked wet on such a hot and sunny day. I went near them and asked why they are wet when it was not raining. They replied, "We are so washed that not even the sun could dry us." I felt sorry for them and gave them my handkerchief and walked away.

C9 2-0

BOSTON MAJOR

REVENGE MATCH PRAYGE

Boston Major MonkaW

FAZE 2-0! REVENGE MATCH for Niko!

Is Tarik playing guys?

Tarik is still in turkey so they're subbing in leaf

We haven't seen curry in action yet with C9 and I think FaZe really does have a good chance but im still taking C9

C9 2-1 FaZe

curry played with c9 vs optic last week.

ye i posted it before the optic game

C9 ez after that performance against optic

C9 2-0

boston

C9 2-1, Curry meshing better with the team

I want to see an upset.  
Leaf has an off day and Babybay and Dicey go giga stupid hard. Faze 2-1

C9B 2-0

FaZe 2-0 no sweat ezaf

C9 2-1

14-16  
16-10  
22-19

Surely Cloud9 wins this one, right?

OMEGALUL

Wait Poach is back?

No

C9 2-1 Faze

Dicey & babybay will take 1 map

Don’t let this match distract you from the fact that FaZe Clan choked a 15-11 lead in the CS:GO Boston Major Final on the final map, Inferno, giving C9 and NA their first Major.

C9 2-0

Who's gonna win???

yk I might just be delusional but I think that FaZe will either get 13-0'd both maps or somehow win 2-1

I agree wid u. There is no in between for this team

C9 2-0

FaZe 2-1 no sweat

faze justifying benching poach for flyuh

poach wasn't even that good I don't know why vlr was crying when he benched

fortnite kids

me when even vlr thought c9 would win that round

might be upset weekend idk  
first 100t and XSET now this

Boston major revenged. No niko no tilt confirmed 💀

SENTINELS MIRACLE RUNNNNNNN

even if sentinels beats c9 13-0 on both maps they still lose due to being -27 in the bracket

flyuh diff

HOLYYYY

there's no beating quandale come on fam

Big D icey diffed 1Leaf

T1 reject diff

no xeta, no meta

curry curse

oh nawr, here comes all the best analysts of vlr/gg where confirmation bias is their only way of reasoning ans logic

Lmao 🤣 told u that without xeta c9 mess up their synergy. Xeta is a great support player that knows how to set up utility for c9 players to shine.

so C9 without korean buff is not that great

JFL y0y

career's been over since the end of 2022 time to let go buddy

EG 0-2 TBD

Lmfaoo

Uhhhhh yeah idk if we got any of these games

Actual best case scenario for 100T, facing a team that bans Sunset. Ban Lotus and let's get a Icebox, Bind, Haven Masterclass

Edit: I don't even fucking know anymore, this team looks atrocious

EG 2-1 TBD. Hope Potter will cook something.

We all know it's gonna be 100T down here let's be fr

100T ban Lotus  
EG ban bind ( if they don’t they lose)  
100T pick Corrode 13-11 EG  
EG pick Haven 13-7 EG  
100T ban Ascent  
EG ban Sunset  
Icebox remains

EG 26-8

Bye bye 100thieves nice team again every year you lose and i am happy

RPGStash vs. Hyperliquid. Battle of the Memecoiners. Trenchers unite!

CLG Chris' Crypto Casino wins! Drop me some solana Runi! I'll trench for 100T.

shit vs. ass

With how poorly 100T played today it gives me hope for EG

EG 2-0 100t are dogwater

Holy trash-off

100T never lose to eg hope it continues mmm

100T about to put me in more despair if they lose this then

snooze fest game

Stoppable object vs movable force

this match is a no brainer for 100t, next match plz

EG winning chances are fairly high

S2pid fks vs s2pid shts

first time 100Throw lose agaist EG

EG loses 2-0 but y0y gets match MVP

Two teams with no midrounding face off 🗿

y0y gets diffed by asugoat

no hope for eg… hot steaming ass

y0y vs asugoat

Evil Geniuses 2-1 Win MVP:yay

demon1 shut these 100t nerds up

100T wins

Surely they can win a match against the one NA team they farmed this year

EG wins

Maps are Haven Ascent decider Sunset

EG wins. No boostio no win for 100T.

100t wins

If 100T loses this, drop everyone except eeiu and cryo

100T 2-0 , icy drops a stinker like usually

how big is 100t's bind playbook? holy fuck

why's icy still in the franchise? is there no better duelist in NA?

with eg budget? no

Corrode pick in such an important match is 10iq move.  
Ez 2-0 100T

Ah yes let’s pick their only good map EG.

5 idiot in eg LOL

This 1v3 by zander is tilting af

100Frauds as usual

icy and asuna fighting for the worst NA duelist in franchise spot

el diablo is back. .

s1s1

el diablo..  
s1..

asuna is selling so haaard

Just kick suck icy

Icy always dies in the most ridiculous way possible. Like whyyyy????

The worst duelist in the world \*\* Icy

Free dies every round by 0cy.

0cy not checking corners. so stupid like your hair.

*sigh* Icy and Nature are probably gonna get benched. They're probably gonna bring in a rookie duelist and probably boostio as igl. Maybe even demon1?

i doubt they'd bring in demon1, him and yay play jett and i doubt either of them could learn how to play raze

This was the holy grail of map vetoes. Anything other than Bind + Corrode and EG would probably have this in the bag

Y0y

EG should of won Corrode but why df are we not banning Bind? Potter ur team not good enough to antistrat a map they aren’t good at.

FaZe 2 -0

is this 2018

NO ITS 2022

GET SMARTER

Hello....... how r u. Boooooooooo 2:0

hopefully c9 can upset Faze

CSGO yes

honestly FaZe has the potential to 13-0 Clown 9 here 😬

Get that faze flair off plz

obvious bait bud

No shit lmao its just cringe

No shit lmao its just cringe - cringe

No shit lmao its just cringe - cringe  
~cringe

**C9 2-1 Faze**

battle of the ages

C9 2-0 Faze. C9 is a diff beast I feel like. Their 3-0 loss to The Guard would have fueled them so much

Reaction?

I was walking on the streets and suddenly I saw all the Cloud9 players soaked wet on such a hot and sunny day. I went near them and asked why they are wet when it was not raining. They replied, "We are so washed that not even the sun could dry us." I felt sorry for them and gave them my handkerchief and walked away.

C9 2-0

BOSTON MAJOR

REVENGE MATCH PRAYGE

Boston Major MonkaW

FAZE 2-0! REVENGE MATCH for Niko!

Is Tarik playing guys?

Tarik is still in turkey so they're subbing in leaf

We haven't seen curry in action yet with C9 and I think FaZe really does have a good chance but im still taking C9

C9 2-1 FaZe

curry played with c9 vs optic last week.

ye i posted it before the optic game

C9 ez after that performance against optic

C9 2-0

boston

C9 2-1, Curry meshing better with the team

I want to see an upset.  
Leaf has an off day and Babybay and Dicey go giga stupid hard. Faze 2-1

C9B 2-0

FaZe 2-0 no sweat ezaf

C9 2-1

14-16  
16-10  
22-19

Surely Cloud9 wins this one, right?

OMEGALUL

Wait Poach is back?

No

C9 2-1 Faze

Dicey & babybay will take 1 map

Don’t let this match distract you from the fact that FaZe Clan choked a 15-11 lead in the CS:GO Boston Major Final on the final map, Inferno, giving C9 and NA their first Major.

C9 2-0

Who's gonna win???

yk I might just be delusional but I think that FaZe will either get 13-0'd both maps or somehow win 2-1

I agree wid u. There is no in between for this team

C9 2-0

FaZe 2-1 no sweat

faze justifying benching poach for flyuh

poach wasn't even that good I don't know why vlr was crying when he benched

fortnite kids

me when even vlr thought c9 would win that round

might be upset weekend idk  
first 100t and XSET now this

Boston major revenged. No niko no tilt confirmed 💀

SENTINELS MIRACLE RUNNNNNNN

even if sentinels beats c9 13-0 on both maps they still lose due to being -27 in the bracket

flyuh diff

HOLYYYY

there's no beating quandale come on fam

Big D icey diffed 1Leaf

T1 reject diff

no xeta, no meta

curry curse

oh nawr, here comes all the best analysts of vlr/gg where confirmation bias is their only way of reasoning ans logic

Lmao 🤣 told u that without xeta c9 mess up their synergy. Xeta is a great support player that knows how to set up utility for c9 players to shine.

so C9 without korean buff is not that great

NO ITS 2022

GET SMARTER

Hello....... how r u. Boooooooooo 2:0

hopefully c9 can upset Faze

CSGO yes

honestly FaZe has the potential to 13-0 Clown 9 here 😬

Get that faze flair off plz

obvious bait bud

No shit lmao its just cringe

No shit lmao its just cringe - cringe

No shit lmao its just cringe - cringe  
~cringe

**C9 2-1 Faze**

battle of the ages

C9 2-0 Faze. C9 is a diff beast I feel like. Their 3-0 loss to The Guard would have fueled them so much

Reaction?

I was walking on the streets and suddenly I saw all the Cloud9 players soaked wet on such a hot and sunny day. I went near them and asked why they are wet when it was not raining. They replied, "We are so washed that not even the sun could dry us." I felt sorry for them and gave them my handkerchief and walked away.

C9 2-0

BOSTON MAJOR

REVENGE MATCH PRAYGE

Boston Major MonkaW

FAZE 2-0! REVENGE MATCH for Niko!

Is Tarik playing guys?

Tarik is still in turkey so they're subbing in leaf

We haven't seen curry in action yet with C9 and I think FaZe really does have a good chance but im still taking C9

C9 2-1 FaZe

curry played with c9 vs optic last week.

ye i posted it before the optic game

C9 ez after that performance against optic

C9 2-0

boston

C9 2-1, Curry meshing better with the team

I want to see an upset.  
Leaf has an off day and Babybay and Dicey go giga stupid hard. Faze 2-1

C9B 2-0

FaZe 2-0 no sweat ezaf

C9 2-1

14-16  
16-10  
22-19

Surely Cloud9 wins this one, right?

OMEGALUL

Wait Poach is back?

No

C9 2-1 Faze

Dicey & babybay will take 1 map

Don’t let this match distract you from the fact that FaZe Clan choked a 15-11 lead in the CS:GO Boston Major Final on the final map, Inferno, giving C9 and NA their first Major.

C9 2-0

Who's gonna win???

yk I might just be delusional but I think that FaZe will either get 13-0'd both maps or somehow win 2-1

I agree wid u. There is no in between for this team

C9 2-0

FaZe 2-1 no sweat

faze justifying benching poach for flyuh

poach wasn't even that good I don't know why vlr was crying when he benched

fortnite kids

me when even vlr thought c9 would win that round

might be upset weekend idk  
first 100t and XSET now this

Boston major revenged. No niko no tilt confirmed 💀

SENTINELS MIRACLE RUNNNNNNN

even if sentinels beats c9 13-0 on both maps they still lose due to being -27 in the bracket

flyuh diff

HOLYYYY

there's no beating quandale come on fam

Big D icey diffed 1Leaf

T1 reject diff

no xeta, no meta

curry curse

oh nawr, here comes all the best analysts of vlr/gg where confirmation bias is their only way of reasoning ans logic

Lmao 🤣 told u that without xeta c9 mess up their synergy. Xeta is a great support player that knows how to set up utility for c9 players to shine.

so C9 without korean buff is not that great

NO ITS 2022

GET SMARTER

Hello....... how r u. Boooooooooo 2:0

hopefully c9 can upset Faze

CSGO yes

honestly FaZe has the potential to 13-0 Clown 9 here 😬

Get that faze flair off plz

obvious bait bud

No shit lmao its just cringe

No shit lmao its just cringe - cringe

No shit lmao its just cringe - cringe  
~cringe

**C9 2-1 Faze**

battle of the ages

C9 2-0 Faze. C9 is a diff beast I feel like. Their 3-0 loss to The Guard would have fueled them so much

Reaction?

I was walking on the streets and suddenly I saw all the Cloud9 players soaked wet on such a hot and sunny day. I went near them and asked why they are wet when it was not raining. They replied, "We are so washed that not even the sun could dry us." I felt sorry for them and gave them my handkerchief and walked away.

C9 2-0

BOSTON MAJOR

REVENGE MATCH PRAYGE

Boston Major MonkaW

FAZE 2-0! REVENGE MATCH for Niko!

Is Tarik playing guys?

Tarik is still in turkey so they're subbing in leaf

We haven't seen curry in action yet with C9 and I think FaZe really does have a good chance but im still taking C9

C9 2-1 FaZe

curry played with c9 vs optic last week.

ye i posted it before the optic game

C9 ez after that performance against optic

C9 2-0

boston

C9 2-1, Curry meshing better with the team

I want to see an upset.  
Leaf has an off day and Babybay and Dicey go giga stupid hard. Faze 2-1

C9B 2-0

FaZe 2-0 no sweat ezaf

C9 2-1

14-16  
16-10  
22-19

Surely Cloud9 wins this one, right?

OMEGALUL

Wait Poach is back?

No

C9 2-1 Faze

Dicey & babybay will take 1 map

Don’t let this match distract you from the fact that FaZe Clan choked a 15-11 lead in the CS:GO Boston Major Final on the final map, Inferno, giving C9 and NA their first Major.

C9 2-0

Who's gonna win???

yk I might just be delusional but I think that FaZe will either get 13-0'd both maps or somehow win 2-1

I agree wid u. There is no in between for this team

C9 2-0

FaZe 2-1 no sweat

faze justifying benching poach for flyuh

poach wasn't even that good I don't know why vlr was crying when he benched

fortnite kids

me when even vlr thought c9 would win that round

might be upset weekend idk  
first 100t and XSET now this

Boston major revenged. No niko no tilt confirmed 💀

SENTINELS MIRACLE RUNNNNNNN

even if sentinels beats c9 13-0 on both maps they still lose due to being -27 in the bracket

flyuh diff

HOLYYYY

there's no beating quandale come on fam

Big D icey diffed 1Leaf

T1 reject diff

no xeta, no meta

curry curse

oh nawr, here comes all the best analysts of vlr/gg where confirmation bias is their only way of reasoning ans logic

Lmao 🤣 told u that without xeta c9 mess up their synergy. Xeta is a great support player that knows how to set up utility for c9 players to shine.

so C9 without korean buff is not that great

History tells us that Optic plays badly in the first game. Faze might 2-1 Optic if that happens but if not then Optic 2-1 Faze

aged like milk. Optic ain't never playing bad in the first game again curse broken. #GREENWALL

**OG 2-1 FAZE**

(*if OG wouldn't stop dicey+babybay duo it could go 2-1/2-0 in favour of Faze*)

"OG 2-1 unless faze win then Faze 2-1 or 2-0"  
?? dude you literally just said either OG win or Faze win

He's just saying he thinks its gonna be a close game that can go either way

Thank u for explaining. Things can get confusing. 👍

OPTIC 2-0

Faze 2-0 Optic  
the smeag gives El diablo diarrhoea via 5g waves and optic have to ff

2-1 Optic

Babybay has a history of smeaging over the best players in the region and it's shown time and time again that you can't stop him by trying to get your star duelist to fight him. He's smeaged over Tenz, Asuna, Corey and Yay before. Yay has also had trouble slowing down and stopping Sayaplayer. Something about OW duelists hits different.

The way you stop Babybay is by cutting him off from his support line and surviving the first engagement. Optic is the best team at fighting a man down and Faze is known to throw rounds when they have the advantage. Marved also knows exactly how Babybay plays. Faze is going to lose some crucial eco rounds, fuck their economy and slowly lose. Babybay stats won't be impressive because of that and people will blame him because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

Time for Faze to get exposed.

FAZE 2-0 POACH DROPS 50 MAP 1

OPTIC 2-0. I think it will take more than the Dicey and Babybay duo to convince me that they will win against Optic.

optic go ein

OpTic 2-0

Smeag diffs L diablo

OpTic 2-1

Classic COD rivalry, very excited for this game

I’m sure all players and coaches watched the matches yesterday, 100T wasn’t messing around pulling out some nice tricks and post plants I wouldn’t be surprised if teams playing today open up their playbooks a bit more. This match is gonna be close and a good insight in how that fast play from faze is going effect some maybe more solid set pieces. I think crashies comes up huge, 2-1 optic

OpTic haven't faced a real team like FaZe since their Envy days against Sentinels. FaZe 2-0 on the backs of NA's best jett player

FaZe 2-0 yay and friends

Do people really have faze winning this?

Some do but I dont, Optic are legit the best team in the world theres no shot we win(jinxing them)

Lol. Good luck to both teams. I think Faze is very good. Hoping for new comp and good match.

2-0 optic

OPTC 2-1 FAZE I wouldnt be suprised if optic lose this one because Rise beat optic on the last first group stage. Happy about any of these teams winning.

the old cod pro league rivalry throwback is gonna make for an interesting valorant match

faze 2-1 optic

I'm kinda scared for faze in the fact that maybe what happened to nrg last stage might happen to them this stage. They're a good team that can make playoffs but going against the best teams in the group early and maybe getting stomped might just remove their confidence and just not let them build any momentum. Just unlucky scheduling u know?

told y'all that babybay's aggressive tactics would fold under good players lol.

Dude Yay and Marved. Also the util use is great from Optic

This is what happens when a good team constantly plays against different styles in international competition. You can see how much optic has learned, improved and literally perfected gameplay. They're slowly growing into maybe a league of legends-ike team that can integrate different comps and adjust while learning new metas fast asf.

I really like how OpTic utilize Neon wall.

Marved so cold🥶

i want optic x loud again

Just to lose again

ok

#freedicey

PRX 🤝 liquid 🤝OpTic

Cringe comps

yay is something else!

Let Victor get used to using Neon and disrupting enemy's space then it will be a pain in the ass for other teams to play against this comp lol.

Optic is on a whole another level

try to beat the cringe.i dare u

lets goo over21.5

finally optic fighting and beating a real team

Marved will be the first one I make fun of when OpTic falls off. That guy tbagging just like Dapr, cocky as fuck.

Cope harder

you're broke + bad + he's a Masters champion LMFAO

You're from Turkey lmao. I'll slap you just like the turkey meat lmaoooo.

? actually braindead

HAHAHAHAHA

cry harder

Faze doing pretty good for a new roster honestly, but overall game as expected Optic does what we thought they would , 2-0

#FaZeDown

Optic is like Bard, above the expectation

wow

optic suffering against faze  
didnt expect that tbh

i know domestic matchups are not good to see the team's level but still....

I didn't see optic suffering. It looked pretty easy for them.

hmmm not sure?

didnt watch the game but optic won 4/4 pistols and score were close still, means they were worse on full buy rounds

I watch the game and they are trolling

what in the retard

Ur a robot no?

He's a Brazil fan of course he's hating on Optic, Loud got stomped on

Faze did good against a team considered the best in NA, unlucky that they're the first team we have to face. New roster shaping up good so far

Dicey and friends

Sheesh yay

========================================
[2025-08-24 15:40:41] LLM PROMPT SENT
========================================
You are an expert assistant. Using only the current webpage content below, answer the user's question by quoting the relevant passage, code block, or table WORD-FOR-WORD, including ALL formatting, indentation, and line breaks. DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or shorten ANY part of the quoted answer, unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize giving the most detailed answer possible by quoting the all relevant text from the content. If the content has numbers, prices, code, tables, or other specific details, quote them exactly as they appear. If multiple relevant passages are found, include ALL of them in their entirety, word-for-word. If the question asks for a specific figure, comparison, change, count, average, percentage, or any analytical summary:
  • First, give a concise DIRECT ANSWER (bullets or a tiny table OK).
  • Then add a short 'How I got this' note showing the calculation or selection logic.
  • Finally, include 1–3 SHORT evidence quotes (each ≤ 300 characters) copied word‑for‑word with exact formatting.
ALWAYS provide which page they should visit to find the exact information they are looking for, if possible, by saying 'Please visit [page URL] for the full details.' If you cite information from a source, always include the full URL shown in the source.If no answer is found, summarize anything related, and politely inform the user that the answer does not appear to be present, suggest a related page by URL if present in the content. Do not hallucinate.At the end, write 'SUFFICIENT: YES' if the answer fully resolves the question, or 'SUFFICIENT: NO' if not. Write 'CONFIDENCE: <0-100>%, based on how confident you are that this answers the question fully'. Write 'Full info or more info: <URL>'

========================================
You are an expert assistant. Using only the current webpage content below, answer the user's question by quoting the relevant passage, code block, or table WORD-FOR-WORD, including ALL formatting, indentation, and line breaks. DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or shorten ANY part of the quoted answer, unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize giving the most detailed answer possible by quoting the all relevant text from the content. If the content has numbers, prices, code, tables, or other specific details, quote them exactly as they appear. If multiple relevant passages are found, include ALL of them in their entirety, word-for-word. If the question asks for a specific figure, comparison, change, count, average, percentage, or any analytical summary:
  • First, give a concise DIRECT ANSWER (bullets or a tiny table OK).
  • Then add a short 'How I got this' note showing the calculation or selection logic.
  • Finally, include 1–3 SHORT evidence quotes (each ≤ 300 characters) copied word‑for‑word with exact formatting.
ALWAYS provide which page they should visit to find the exact information they are looking for, if possible, by saying 'Please visit [page URL] for the full details.' If you cite information from a source, always include the full URL shown in the source.If no answer is found, summarize anything related, and politely inform the user that the answer does not appear to be present, suggest a related page by URL if present in the content. Do not hallucinate.At the end, write 'SUFFICIENT: YES' if the answer fully resolves the question, or 'SUFFICIENT: NO' if not. Write 'CONFIDENCE: <0-100>%, based on how confident you are that this answers the question fully'. Write 'Full info or more info: <URL>'

FURIA 2-0

BABYBAY drops 50 and sends FURIA back to tier 6

BABYBAY drops 101 and makes FURIA quit franchising

furia have a chance if they drop urango or he starts shooting

bro was NOT a good fragger even in tier 2

ur mango

can FURIA win a map

Betting against G2 with a 100% guarantee

We getting 1.00 odds with this match 🗣🔥🔥

it is basically a 4v5, even insane players like heat cannot carry urango

i thought basic was on 2g

oh shit my bad

no basic moved to furia

basic played for 2G academy and then Furia picked him up but visa issues (riot small indie company moment)

honestly I’d rather stay in tier 2 than go to Furia

maybe furia puts up a fight like they just did in league

hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby ahh match

no tejo yes win

a furia surpreenderá e ganhará dessa farsa da g2

nem o basic salva mais, estou cansado chefe

KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

valorant speedrun

G26-0

G2 LETS BABYBAY TRY TO 1V5 EVERY ROUND AND HE DROPS 40 PER MAP  
G2 WIN 13-4 13-4

the question is: will f0ria get a round

G2 26-7 FUR

?????

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO

KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

How in the actual hell man

question is how many rounds will furia get?  
I'm saying 8, G2 26-8

Furia would be relegated out of tier 2

furia 2-0, urango drops 100

on paper g2 win

betting 13-0 on both maps if leaf is coming back

Apparently leaf is back well uhh Furia y'all have no chance at all..

The best Furia can do is 2-1. Teams like APK , Furia are only good for 1 map.

G2 can play w a silver and still win

Hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby

quick and easy FUR 2-0 G2, they don’t even stand a chance against the mighty urango 🔋❤️‍🩹🌹🌹

Betters are so stupid. they can’t understand this is the average storyline where the worst team comes together wins against the best in a 2-1 ot victory barley makes playoffs and then goes all the way to become champions. Furia valo champs of 2025. Trust in the process.

Babybae clears them.

If G2 doesn't ban Bind, we'll see bind.

If not, maps should be Lotus Haven and Corrode.

another 13-0? (puta q pariu, brasileiro so se fode nesse mundinho)

Urango MVP

They should kick heat for raafa and have urango and raafa co igl

Why would they kick their best player and bring in their worst player from the last stage? One of the monumental problems this team has is the lack of firepower; downgrading in this aspect would make the team even worse.

FUR ban Lotus, G2 ban Corrode, FUR pick Icebox, G2 pick Ascent, FUR ban Haven, G2 ban Sunset, Bind Remains.

G2 win Icebox 13-6  
G2 win Ascent 13-2

G2 win 2-0

This will be sad.

Close smh

nah this is where u gotta put 100 dolla on furia

Hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby

on EVERYONES SOUL furia 26-0

inb4 furia win

G2 trolls and 2-1 furia with 100-98 OT final map

2-0 g2 with bay getting signed permanently as backup

I Just bet my life savings agains FURIA. If G2 choke then i am done for

APK vs FNC americas version

poor tuyz bro experienced prime loud and now he has Urango as a IGL

It ain't happening but it would be so funny

A supernova vs a prokaryote

the big bang vs a sperm in a used condom

i was gonna comment "shit vs poop" but realised it was g2 and not 2g LOL

Why yhey took out adverso? Even I am better than Urango

Sure, buddy

You being ironic or not (i was kidding about me being better than Urango)?

leaf is back 🥶

baby bomb vs. coughing hydrogen

putting the house on FURIA, wish me luck ♥️

+1 homless person in NA

best match of all time incoming

furia about to be molested 🙏😭

G2 2:0

if furia wins I go bald

wait so basic will finally play tday?

No, and is better to him do not play until this shit team get disbanded

lmao

babybang

Its absolutely fascinating for constantly useless Furia is

Fúria should get relegated in the place of 2g

disband furia pls

All part of the plan. Trust in the process.

the process for Furia to lose of course I was talking about

make a wish game

please g2 dont waste my time

😭🤣🫵🏻 Coloca o time do lol, CS ou sei lá, coloca os cara do Rocket League para terminar o split, deixa só o Heat e o Basic

AHAHAHAHAHA  
Ahahahahahah I lose 18.5 over like this

5 8  
Annnnd  
Throw full eco  
Throw 3v2 on bomb  
Throw last 4v2(2v1) full info afk walk on side AhahahahahaAHAHAHAHAHAH

WHAT a do6s 322

why are you betting on furia respectfully. what did you expect

you get what you deserve

furia L

bro

Furia really have low game iq, why did he tap the bomb again at 2 seconds? Otherwise, Johnap would have peeked, and now he knows it was fake.

In 2 rounds on Ascent map, “Heat” fixed the result in round 15. I thought it was obvious, but in round 17, his fake was even more obvious.

Stop betting on Furia u dumb ass

Congrats furia being the worst team on franchise history!

G2 should pick Urango to IGL, instead leaf return

what a horrible team

Hey atleast it’s FURIA getting blown out not M80 or SRB right Riot?🤣🤣🤣 fucking joke of a company legit doing everything they can to minimize viewership bunch of zellsis words that can’t admit they were wrong when it comes to franchising

Heat is legit playing for stats. No help in retakes and doesn't even attempt at trading. Full baiting on viper and even on Chamber.

Feel bad for Palla as he's actually trying to play his role, but the others look like they're playing more for their VLR page.

yay DEVOURS G2 and takes valyn's hairline to restore his own

u guys really think EG can defeat G2 ?  
I almost feel sorry for u guys

I feel like EG still has a very good chance no?  
I have no doubt in g2 but without leaf things get a lot harder for them.

G2 2-0  
BABYBAY DROPS 60.

el diablo

Icy is TERRIBLE

el diablo knifed jawgemo lmfao

Evil Geniuses 2-1 Win MVP:supamen

And again Dumb2 with worst ascent attack ever  
They gonna lose this for sure

Respectfully

yay uses ult on jett just to get knife out and walk with it  
insane IQ

and yeah paid actor potter with timeout pretending she knows anything about this game XD disband this team

Icy might be the worst tier 1 player currently

he's really bad but worst is so far from the truth. have you considered the entirety of furia? what about batujnax from apex. or perhaps zesbeew.

Furia shouldn't be considered tier 1

heat would 100-0 icy in a 1v1

heat the only good player on furia

urango?

damn jonahp you are like that?

icy is probably the worst player in franchise, i dont understand why potter picked him

she was the one who dropped the other guy for this bum

Urango disagree

G2 just had all the momentum. Corrode was their warmup lmfao

ggwp G2, EG i still love you

no way riot put ender and doug on the same cast lol 0 game knowledge incoming

bros yapping

Icy is such a fraud

Not again…

icy might be one of the worst to do it

bring back demon1

I'm stupid

Stay at home, yay.

Icy needs to go man

Lev will be here

You misspelt Leaf bro I gotchu

LMAO

not so easy to say that they misspelt Babybay

G2 2-0 100T

100T 26 - 0 G2

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA EZ WIN G2

close enough, but otherway round

100T should win a corrode so really should be G2-100T

Oh damn 😂

I cant wait for sunset and lotus just dont know map 3.

map 3?

Please fucking ban Lotus, it's all I ask

banning lotus aint gonna help you against g2 with king babybae lil bro

could have had first seed but here we are

TBD 2-0 100T

dude above me is the least obvious jinx

map pool:

100T A  
G2 B

100T ban Lotus, G2 ban Bind, 100T pick Corrode, G2 pick Ascent, 100T ban Haven, G2 ban Sunset, Icebox Remains

1/3

is leaf back

100T ban Lotus, G2 ban Bind, 100T pick Haven, G2 pick Ascent, 100T ban Sunset, G2 ban Icebox, Corrode Remains.

G2 win Haven 13-11  
G2 win Ascent 13-5

G2 win 2-0

100T needs a better map pool

BABYBAY DROPS A HUGE SHIT ALL OVER100T

26-19

Imagine if Leaf is still not back and they take Babybay all the way through the playoffs and win Stage 2 with him

Honestly its possible.. Babybay isnt even all that bad they 2-0'd C9 and babybay was mvp so.

100T win condition is picking into Bind and Corrode somehow:  
give asuna his adderall.  
and just to turn up on the day.  
Statistically 100Ts Bind has always been good, their corrode looked alr too

I'm more hopeful for a lower bracket run

Bind is G2's perma ban

The only chance 100T has is if G2 just want to practice their Bind for Champs so they don't ban it since they are already qualified but I doubt it

we're so cooked

Even though G2 is better 100T can win this. G2 is saving strats and don't care anymore.

100t pls win so it becomes easy for NRG

<

100T 2-0

100T 2-1

hi

100T either squeak it out or lose by a mile  
100T 2-1 Prayge

Gamers2 are getting exposed

Both can do the funniest thing (one by throwing, the other being kess becoming prime Von, halfway there alr)

This is, uh, gonna be... mm... well it's gonna be... something...

lotus or sunset is through so g2 already a map up

if babybay is cooking again this region is legitimately cooked

americas is already exposed bro

100 Thieves 2-1 Win MVP:eeiu

100T win.........................................................................................................................................................................I hope

burger league

If they lose to BabyBay I quit

“pros don’t fake”  
checks out considering valyn sucks

zander always the first one to die dafq

Have you checked the stats? Asuna 12 FD

Asuna does nothing for this team

getting bullied by a caster

Nice map pick 100T

The pecking order  
G2  
JoshRT  
Babybay's chair  
The worms inside the dirt  
The dirt  
100t

(Its not an insult, its a reference, dbza episode 6)

FaZe smeagul is back

Maptrade 11111100000203030%

Shocked that babybay is the highest rated player

BABYBAY FIRST MATCH MVP LETS GO MY GOAT

who needs leaf when you have BABYBAY  
chron's disease? more like CHRONIC SUPREMACY

Can't wait for the "it wasn't our day" tweet followed by the "we will try harder next time" and ultimately the "we will get them next season." Love the competitive spirit 100 Thieves.

Thank god we live in an influencer era that doesn't really give a crap about accountability or winning.

5 years of assuna just to get owned by a caster sub btw

Thrifty

this make FURIA and 2G look better

BABYBAY

BABYBAY... 30 years old bro back to business showing them kids how it's done. 😈

Hydrogen bomb vs Coughing baby

lets go babybay

Could have been an email.

BABYGOAT

26-9 is crazy

I’m surprised they even got 9 that was awful

Asuna 1/12 FK/FD is BRUTAL

assuna

asunyan should go vtubing

JoshRT gave 100t way too much respect in the mid-map interview.

Playoffs but stomp fiesta🥀💔

Well, that was certainly... a match.

babybay putting better numbers than some tier 1 players is crazy

Babybay is tier 1 he got done dirty on faze

babybay is getting comfortable lmfao

time to kick asuna

Close game

aint no way there are no americas teams that could win against G2 except SEN...

30 year old man fists 100paraplegics

and they say middle pack teams are closer to TOP teams (G2, SEN) lemau

Asuna the god of inconsistency.

100T when they can't play bind:

1.22 ods were telling u that there are some crazy lunatic thinks 100t can win against g2

asuna PLEASEEEEE I BELIEVED IN UUUU

G2 2-0 000thieves

g2 2-1 energy esports

every g2 player gets food poisoning for an NRG 2-0

NRG 2-1

this mf the biggest jinx ever

:)

i hope sen win 2-0 and win all of americas and then win champs :)))))

They are never going to win champs with this roster. Their only hope was last year with TenZ and Sacy.

Im not a religious person but please god nrg win

💔 all good we got lowers (99% faith 1% chance)

More like 99% chance 100% Faith NRG is stomping any team other than G2 n Sen

100T 2-1 NOT EVEN CLOSEE

100mid

This will be a banger game to watch hopefully

If i’m nrg, i’d just ff, group omega is cooked

Thank goodness you're not nrg

Yes, thank goodness I’m not a bum team

NRG 2-0 —> 13-4 13-3

lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Nrg 2-1 G2  
6 13  
13 11  
14 12

NRG 2-0 #s0mdiff

#s0mdiff

they dont got the energy(NRG) to beat the smeag

G2-0

G2 ban Corrode, NRG ban Sunset, G2 pick Ascent, NRG pick Lotus, G2 ban Bind, NRG ban Haven, Icebox Remains.

G2 win Ascent 13-8  
NRG win Lotus 14-12  
G2 win Icebox 13-8

G2 win 2-1.

It could be a way more dominant series from G2. NRG seems very dependent on momentum, and getting 1st seed might jeopardize that

How tf did you go 0-3 in map picks 😭

I underestimated how bad NRG's Ascent was

NRG 2-1 Skuba just diff

G2 2-1 NRG  
This is not gonna be easy, but Babybay & Co. are gonna do it.

NRG 2-1  
G2 is saving strats

NRG 2-0 13-0, 13-0  
BabyGOAT wont be able to carry these bums against serious team not named 100Frauds

Unc babybay >>>>>> Fraud brawk

actually gonna be a pretty good game i hope

this sh\*t cant be endless. NRG should break this caster's run

this si gonna be soooo gooooood

G2 wins with Babybay aren't impressive  
2G  
EG  
FURIA  
C9  
100T  
NRG winning this  
Thank me later

?

Did...did you not see babybay being better than 30% of pro players.....? I get the wins aren't against Paper Rex or EDG or something but.....did you even watch any of these games?

NRG 2-1 Win MVP:skuba

Ascent Haven Lotus. PLEASE

Nrg realy have chance

g2-0 Nrg is just a rebranded c9

SMEAG2-0 NRG

eth0n disasterclass incoming

G2 2-0 13-5 13-8

Mada disasterclass

Well at least I was right about mada being ssa

NRG 2-1, great map picks and bans

every team now copying jemkin waylay on corrode lol

Shit ass map

just look at g2s map bans, it will explain why they will lose this series

Let's go Nrg

Well thrown G2

xdddddddd 5v2 lose to s0m

Babyday hears 10 people in door and decides to stop watching it after tp. Straight up to lb

Babybay lowkey carrying g2

Mada jogando oq não jogou na fase grupos slk

NRG attack side bruhhh.... 🤦‍♂️

G2's best player is a 50 year old caster.

How can you lose to so many thrifty rounds in 1 map?

my eyes bleeding when i see this bronze plays on bind by nrg. losing to a team which dont play bind + standin. just disband xddd

G2 were rly good the whole time on bind what are you on about

Nah. BS NA valorant. Full of fixed games since yesterday. Yuck

0/8

G2 trying so hard even though they qualed💀

If NRG comebacks from this I'll be very impressed but G2 doesn't choke a lead like this right?

NRG looked like stage 2 winners for like one hour and now we are back to normal

nrg lost like 10 ecos this series XDDD 2-0 2-10 btw legit

THRIFTY AGAIN. HAHAHA NA VALORANT

Bro, this is FAZE BABYBAY! Smeag!!

what a clutch s0m

LESGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

ez for Faze karrigan

-20 sheesh that's my igl....wait

At least that was a nice 1v4

something something W stripper something something

NRG should’ve had Sunset. Bind was a G2 masterclass.

Damn. GGWP G2, let’s see if NRG’s mental is crushed

how is brawk even playing in tier 1 bro

because verno knocked fns out

4 games in a row now a caster owning these tier 1 teams, says a lot about the region

no one can beat my boys. even when trent is having the unluckiest series of his life, the champs prevail. 3peat incoming.

sen are about to have a field day against the frauds. mark my word lil bro

Sen barely beating fraud9😭✌🏻

g2 barely beating nrg lmfao

Babybay looks good now

Babybay the goat

I looked at the G2 bind comp and thought "WHAT THE F\*\*\* ARE WE DOING?????"

I was then stabbed 16 times in the right knee for doubting

That was like watching a Minecraft build montage. I know what's happening, I understand it, but I sure as hell can't replicate it

NA losing to 30yo caster lmfaoooo

C9 go onstage worried and scared, they get bent over throughout map 1, aside from a few hero plays, C9 is a trainwreck, but in map 2, the bald light of immi's head reinvigorates C9, and the next game, my glorious king xeppaa loses 20kg, and plays the best hes ever played, Mitch's IGL is horrendous and usual but Xeppaa goes god mode and C9 is able to wrench map 2 from G2. In the final map, a C9 fan throws a brick at leaf's round ass head, knocking him clean out, and because there was already a tech pause for 3 hours in the last map, the game continues, and G2 without their hard carry, is as good as 2g. GG EZ, c9 win in a clean 2-1 series where they lay significant pipe into G2's behind

C9 2-1 G2

This Guy has all Scripts Written for all League Matches, But His Story Ends once team enters into Playoffs

"this guy" also hacked into riot headquaters to get the official vct script and he simply shares its contents with the ungrateful, they called jesus a false prophet too. so be careful buddy cause I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.

and You are 16 yrs Old

will be rooting for G2 for the first ever time since they need to win this for 2G to have a chance at making playoffs… any tips from G2 fans (if you exist)

You might go cross eyed but keep an eye on the minimap if you wanna enjoy the macro. Sliggy co-streams are great for it too!

C9 ban Ascent, G2 ban Sunset, C9 pick Bind, G2 pick Lotus, C9 ban Icebox, G2 ban Haven, Corrode Remains.

G2 win Bind 13-11  
G2 win Lotus 13-8

G2 win 2-0

Looks fair

1/7 holy shit im buns

C9 2-0  
Easy for v1c

Is leaf going to play in this game?

Doesn't matter simple IGL diff

If leaf plays 2-0 if not 2-1

*winning this match for g2 means they are gonna play 100 thieves, losing means they get leviathan.. interesting . . .*

C9 2-0  
Oxy clears

only plays well vs shit teams, turns into dambi vs teams that shoot back

Dambi is not bad lol

didnt say he was bad, hes just mid

Isn’t this game basically meaningless for playoffs

Not gonna lie, this map prediction is ass. Doubt G2 or C9 will ban Sunset

maps should be Haven Ascent decider Sunset C9 will not play Lotus on G2 lol

lmao

it's tough out here bro

Sorry c9, you have no chance  
G2-0

G2 Win

leaf is back so this mean's G2 win clean. joever for oxy

wait babybay still in game, g2 might lose

I hope Babybay plays this game! Let Leaf keep resting!

Americas is sad because every game with G2 and sen Against anyone else is a forgone conclusion

caster is cooking

C9 is the definition of mid

G2 2-0 Cloud9

BABYBAY MASTERCLASS

free for g2  
oxy diasterclass as always against real team

Bro got the most kills in the match

babyyay too so what?  
what i said its a straight fact

ummmm....

He had the most kills in the match and went +4 in first bloods, highest ACS, Highest Rating.

Cloud9 2-1 Win MVP:v1c

Not before - xeppa - Mitch, but all immediately after they bomb out of playoffs

Immi is a good coach

C9 2-0 G2
Group stage merchant strikes again. Though winning this will mean nothing as C9 will still go 0-4 in playoffs, losing to 000thieves and 2 game esports to close the year out.

CLOUD 9 THRUST A TIGHT WIN FROM THE JAWS OF DEFEAT

C9 go onstage worried and scared, they get bent over throughout map 1, aside from a few hero plays, C9 is a trainwreck, but in map 2, the bald light of immi's head reinvigorates C9, and the next game, my glorious king xeppaa loses 20kg, and plays the best hes ever played, Mitch's IGL is horrendous and usual but Xeppaa goes god mode and C9 is able to wrench map 2 from G2. In the final map, a C9 fan throws a brick at leaf's round ass head, knocking him clean out, and because there was already a tech pause for 3 hours in the last map, the game continues, and G2 without their hard carry, is as good as 2g. GG EZ, c9 win in a clean 2-1 series where they lay significant pipe into G2's behind

C9 2-1 G2
