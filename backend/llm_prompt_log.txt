* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

Testimonials collected from actual satisfied T-Mobile Home Internet customers.

* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + The T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™  plans have our 5-year price guarantee so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes (exclusions like taxes and fees apply).
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How fast is 5G home internet (in Mbps) compared to cable?

  T-Mobile All-In or Amplified Home Internet customers delivering typical speeds between 134 mbps – 415 mbps. Typical upload speeds are between 12 – 55 Mbps. 25% of our customers see speeds below and 25% see speeds above these ranges.

  Keep in mind that speeds can vary depending on location, time of day, signal strength and availability, and other factors. Click here for more info.

Best of all, you have nothing to lose, since you can try out T-Mobile Home Internet first to make sure you find a plan that works for you.
* ### Do these plans come with 5-Year price guarantee?

  Yes, new and upgrading customers on the T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™ plans are covered by our 5- year price guarantee. 5-year price guarantee means that we won't change the price of fixed-wireless 5G internet data for at least 5 years while you are on an eligible plan. Taxes & fees, voluntary equipment or speed upgrades, future wireless generations, select limited-time promotions, per-use charges, third-party services, and network management practices aren't included.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

* ### Why am I not eligible for 5G internet?

  The service is available in select areas based on T-Mobile's current wireless network. It may not be available in your area yet, but as we expand T-Mobile Home Internet, we'll prioritize areas with the highest demand.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* ### I don't live in any of the cities with a Riot office. Is there an opportunity to work remotely?

  We take a hybrid approach by entrusting teams to decide the right rhythm for in-person vs remote work. With that being said, we’ll still expect most Rioters to live in the same state as their home office (or the same country in the case of our global offices).
* ### I want to work at one of Riot's global offices but I’m not a citizen of that country. Is that possible?

  Working globally depends on the immigration restrictions of the relevant country/region. If you apply to a role in a global office, those recruiting teams will respond if they see a match.
* ### Can I apply for multiple jobs?

  We want applicants to think deeply about their skills and interest—and how they line up with the jobs available at Riot. It's not a good sign if you find yourself applying to as many open positions as possible.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* ### I don't live in any of the cities with a Riot office. Is there an opportunity to work remotely?

  We take a hybrid approach by entrusting teams to decide the right rhythm for in-person vs remote work. With that being said, we’ll still expect most Rioters to live in the same state as their home office (or the same country in the case of our global offices).
* ### I want to work at one of Riot's global offices but I’m not a citizen of that country. Is that possible?

  Working globally depends on the immigration restrictions of the relevant country/region. If you apply to a role in a global office, those recruiting teams will respond if they see a match.
* ### Can I apply for multiple jobs?

  We want applicants to think deeply about their skills and interest—and how they line up with the jobs available at Riot. It's not a good sign if you find yourself applying to as many open positions as possible.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### How is T-Mobile Fiber internet installed?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.
* ### Why is fiber technology better than cable?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will i be charged for installation?

  Nope! Installation is included in the cost of your plan.
* ### Why am I not eligible for 5G internet?

  The service is available in select areas based on T-Mobile's current wireless network. It may not be available in your area yet, but as we expand T-Mobile Home Internet, we'll prioritize areas with the highest demand.

* ### Do these plans come with 5-Year price guarantee?

  Yes, new and upgrading customers on the T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™ plans are covered by our 5- year price guarantee. 5-year price guarantee means that we won't change the price of fixed-wireless 5G internet data for at least 5 years while you are on an eligible plan. Taxes & fees, voluntary equipment or speed upgrades, future wireless generations, select limited-time promotions, per-use charges, third-party services, and network management practices aren't included.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.

  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

  The service is available in select areas based on T-Mobile's current wireless network. It may not be available in your area yet, but as we expand T-Mobile Home Internet, we'll prioritize areas with the highest demand.

IAM Policies Hands On
Introduction to IAM Policies

Let's examine IAM policies in depth. First, navigate to the users section. For example, the user Stephane is part of the admin group, which grants administrator access permissions to AWS.

Using the user Stephane to access the IAM console, you can see the user listed under users. Since Stephane belongs to the admin group, they have permission to perform any action as an administrator.

Removing User from Admin Group

To demonstrate permission changes, remove the user Stephane from the admin group. Once removed, Stephane loses the administrator permissions previously granted by the group.

After removal, refreshing the users page results in an access denied error, indicating that the user no longer has permission to perform the iamListUsers action. This confirms that removing a user from a group revokes their permissions accordingly.

Restoring Permissions by Attaching Policies

To restore permissions for Stephane, navigate to the user and add permissions. Instead of adding the user back to a group, attach policies directly to the user. For example, attach the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy to allow read-only access to IAM resources.

After attaching the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy, refreshing the users page allows viewing users and user groups but restricts creating new groups. Attempting to create a group results in an access denied error, demonstrating that read-only access limits modification capabilities.

This example illustrates that permissions should be granted strictly according to the user's required actions. To allow creating groups, a broader permission set such as IAM full access must be attached.

Creating User Groups and Assigning Policies

Next, create a new group named developers. Add the user Stephane to this group and attach any policy, such as AlexaForBusiness, to demonstrate policy inheritance through groups.

Also, re-add Stephane to the admin group. Now, the user Stephane has multiple permission policies attached: administrator access inherited from the admin group, AlexaForBusiness managed policy from the developers group, and the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy attached directly.

This demonstrates how permissions can be inherited from multiple sources, including groups and direct attachments.

Understanding IAM Policies in Detail

Navigate to the policies section to examine specific policies. For example, the AdministratorAccess policy grants full access to all AWS services and resources.

Viewing the JSON of this policy reveals that it allows all actions (Action: "*") on all resources (Resource: "*"). This effectively grants administrator access.

In contrast, the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy authorizes specific API calls such as List and Get actions on IAM resources. The JSON document lists allowed actions like iam:ListUsers and iam:GetUser with effect set to allow.

Using wildcards such as Get* or List* groups multiple API calls together, simplifying policy definitions.

Creating Custom IAM Policies

You can create custom policies using either the visual editor or the JSON editor. For example, to create a policy that allows only ListUsers and GetUser actions on IAM, select these actions in the visual editor and specify the resources to which the policy applies.

After creating the policy, review the JSON to confirm that it includes the intended permissions. This custom policy can then be attached to users or groups as needed.

Cleaning Up and Finalizing

To conclude, delete the developers group if it is no longer needed. Remove any directly attached policies such as IAMReadOnlyAccess from the user Stephane, leaving only the admin group membership with administrator access.

Verifying the IAM console shows that the user Stephane has full access again, confirming that permissions are correctly managed through group memberships and attached policies.

Key Takeaways
IAM user permissions are managed through group memberships and attached policies.
Removing a user from an admin group revokes their administrator access immediately.
Read-only access policies allow viewing but restrict modification actions.
Custom IAM policies can be created using the visual or JSON editor to specify precise permissions.

IAM Policies Hands On
Introduction to IAM Policies

Let's examine IAM policies in depth. First, navigate to the users section. For example, the user Stephane is part of the admin group, which grants administrator access permissions to AWS.

Using the user Stephane to access the IAM console, you can see the user listed under users. Since Stephane belongs to the admin group, they have permission to perform any action as an administrator.

Removing User from Admin Group

To demonstrate permission changes, remove the user Stephane from the admin group. Once removed, Stephane loses the administrator permissions previously granted by the group.

After removal, refreshing the users page results in an access denied error, indicating that the user no longer has permission to perform the iamListUsers action. This confirms that removing a user from a group revokes their permissions accordingly.

Restoring Permissions by Attaching Policies

To restore permissions for Stephane, navigate to the user and add permissions. Instead of adding the user back to a group, attach policies directly to the user. For example, attach the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy to allow read-only access to IAM resources.

After attaching the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy, refreshing the users page allows viewing users and user groups but restricts creating new groups. Attempting to create a group results in an access denied error, demonstrating that read-only access limits modification capabilities.

This example illustrates that permissions should be granted strictly according to the user's required actions. To allow creating groups, a broader permission set such as IAM full access must be attached.

Creating User Groups and Assigning Policies

Next, create a new group named developers. Add the user Stephane to this group and attach any policy, such as AlexaForBusiness, to demonstrate policy inheritance through groups.

Also, re-add Stephane to the admin group. Now, the user Stephane has multiple permission policies attached: administrator access inherited from the admin group, AlexaForBusiness managed policy from the developers group, and the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy attached directly.

This demonstrates how permissions can be inherited from multiple sources, including groups and direct attachments.

Understanding IAM Policies in Detail

Navigate to the policies section to examine specific policies. For example, the AdministratorAccess policy grants full access to all AWS services and resources.

Viewing the JSON of this policy reveals that it allows all actions (Action: "*") on all resources (Resource: "*"). This effectively grants administrator access.

In contrast, the IAMReadOnlyAccess policy authorizes specific API calls such as List and Get actions on IAM resources. The JSON document lists allowed actions like iam:ListUsers and iam:GetUser with effect set to allow.

Using wildcards such as Get* or List* groups multiple API calls together, simplifying policy definitions.

Creating Custom IAM Policies

You can create custom policies using either the visual editor or the JSON editor. For example, to create a policy that allows only ListUsers and GetUser actions on IAM, select these actions in the visual editor and specify the resources to which the policy applies.

After creating the policy, review the JSON to confirm that it includes the intended permissions. This custom policy can then be attached to users or groups as needed.

Cleaning Up and Finalizing

To conclude, delete the developers group if it is no longer needed. Remove any directly attached policies such as IAMReadOnlyAccess from the user Stephane, leaving only the admin group membership with administrator access.

Verifying the IAM console shows that the user Stephane has full access again, confirming that permissions are correctly managed through group memberships and attached policies.

Key Takeaways
IAM user permissions are managed through group memberships and attached policies.
Removing a user from an admin group revokes their administrator access immediately.
Read-only access policies allow viewing but restrict modification actions.
Custom IAM policies can be created using the visual or JSON editor to specify precise permissions.

AI may make mistakes. Verify for accuracy.

The area
2 Chome-2-1 Dogenzaka, Shibuya 150-0043 Tokyo Prefecture
Neighborhood: Shibuya / Harajuku / Ebisu
There are countless opportunities to shop in the Shibuya and Harajuku districts, especially in shops that focus on Japan's "Kawaii" culture. The trendiest areas are around Shibuya’s Center district, Harajuku's Takeshita-dori and in Omotesando. If you need to recharge from all the shopping, you can easily refresh yourself in Meiji Jingu or Sasaki Park. In contrast, Ebisu has a more grown up ambiance of calm and cool. At the Museum of Yebisu Beer you can learn about the beer that was responsible for the town’s name, and enjoy dining at the popular noodle shops in the surrounding area.

Definitely a must-visit if you’re in Tokyo — it’s one of the most iconic and busiest pedestrian crossings in the world. When the light turns green, you’ll see hundreds of people flowing from every direction at once. It’s a surreal experience, especially at night when the neon lights and giant screens light up the intersection. There’s always something going on around the area too — street performers, pop-up ads, and people filming content. For one of the best views from above, head to the Magnet mall building. On the rooftop, there’s a small bar with a terrace that overlooks the crossing — a perfect spot for taking photos or videos. The bar itself isn’t anything special and entry requires you to buy at least one drink, but the view makes it absolutely worth it. Tip: Try visiting at around 5-7pm or after sunset for the most dramatic visuals. And if the Magnet rooftop feels too crowded, other viewpoints include the Starbucks in Tsutaya or the Shibuya Sky observation deck — though those might be busier or more expensive.

A definite must stop in Tokyo and there are a number of viewing spots from above. You can view for free from the walkway in the shopping centre, go to Starbucks and compete with the crowds for the window, pay a fortune to go up the Shibuya scramble tower (which may be too high???) or go to the Magnet bar - in the block on the right next to Starbucks (as you look at Starbucks). Take the lift to the top floor and for a small fee there is a small bar where you get a drink (coffee/beer/soft drink) included in the price. Plenty of space and a lovely place for an early evening beer to watch the crossing.

I admit it: I arrived very charged. A thousand videos watched, epic scenes in movies, skyrocketing expectations. I imagined a giant intersection, like Times Square with Godzilla crossing the stripes. Instead... eh. It's big, yes, but not HUGE. Live it almost looks like a normal crossing... only with more people, lights and selfie sticks per square meter. But be careful: it's not a scam. It's a perfectly choreographed little mess. When the green shoots in and hundreds of people cross at once from every direction, you feel part of an urban musical in which everyone acts without knowing they are doing it. The real show? Look at it from above: Starbucks or one of the various viewpoints around. That's where you get the magic. On the ground you're just a guy trying not to get hit by a tourist on a scooter. In summary: – Mythical? Yes. – Giant as in the videos? Not really. – To see at least once? Absolutely not. Shibuya Crossing: small, crowded, a bit overrated, but in the end... it gets to your heart. And in Instagram stories. 📸✨

The Shibuya Crossing is a must-see pedestrian crossing in Tokyo, photographed from all angles. A human tide passes through it alternately with cars, whether diagonally or horizontally. Do not hesitate to go day or night, the effect will not be the same! You can observe it for free from many places, such as Shibuya Station tonight, shops nearby or for a fee from buildings like ShibuyaSky for example.

Stepping into Shibuya Crossing is like stepping into the pulse of Tokyo. When the lights turn red for cars, hundreds (sometimes thousands) of pedestrians flood the intersection from all directions. It’s a mesmerizing sight to see people moving in perfect synchronization, crossing in every direction, yet it’s incredibly organized despite the chaos. It is a must see sight for sure. Also the shops nearby are very nice options to buy sourveniers and gifts from Japan.

This is very busy but it's unnecessarily filled with tourists stopping to take pics and video. Surprisingly the traffic moves smooth regardless of the crowd. No cars are honking (not allowed). No cars get "stuck" in the middle of the intersection. It's overcrowded b/c the Shibuya train station is also at that intersection and it was under constructions in Oct 2024.

Shibuya Crossing is an amazing place where thousands of people cross the street in every direction every few minutes. We got to cross the street and then we went up into a building a few floors to take some pictures of the crowds below. It is the bussiest street crossing in the world.

Lots of shops and restaurants in Shibuya, but the crossing was a bit disappointing to me as I realised - it's just a road crossing! OK there's lots of stripes diagonally but that't because Japanese people have to follow the rules and they would not cross diagonally until you draw a crossing on the road. Good for a photo but not much else, I went up to the Starbucks for a free photo otherwise there are some restaurants/bars that have a view higher up.

This is a must see if you are in Tokyo. Go on the subway/JR lines it is right outside the subway exit. It is like a ballet with cars halting people swarming across is all directions then suddenly stopping and cars going again. I could watch it for hours.

One of the main Landmarks of Tokyo
May 2025 • Friends
This is one of the main landmarks of Tokyo. It is just a square, but I think it's so iconic that it's worth a visit. You should definitely cross the diagonal crosswalk and take a picture or two. There are quite a few options to view the crossing from above. We booked the shibuya sky, which is pretty high up and you have to book well in advance, right when the tickets are released. But there are plenty of other options to view the crossing from a bit closer. What's also fun is to take a timelapse video of people crossing the crosswalks. All in all, I think it's a touristy thing to do but still worth it.

It's right in front of the subway station. It's a very well-known place where hundreds of people pass by at the same time without anyone hitting. It's a place where many Japanese fixed cars go by. Known for the movie Fast and Furious Tokyo

Fun while crossing
Jul 2025 • Couples
We first saw Shibuya Crossing a few minutes after arriving by bus from the airport to Tokyo, still with our suitcases. And then we returned here several more times during our stay in Tokyo.

It was fun to watch people (mostly tourists, Japanese people just crossing) taking pictures, filming and posing while crossing. We did the same. :-) Yes, it is an iconic place and if you are in Tokyo, you definitely shouldn't miss it.

Very busy intersection, in itself not so special but nice to have walked over once.
Many nice shops in DE neighborhood. At DE Shibuya crossing is a restaurant/bar where you have a view over the intersection.

Our iconic neighborhood where thousands of people run to the right to the left, with shops that appeal mostly to under 20, where the nightlife is bustling...
Going with a kid can be torture,even with hundreds in the subway.
Going just to see one day, it’s probably the cheapest Shopping and dining in Tokyo.
If you’re staying in the center, you can get around 15dk from Tokyo Station with one line.

Great buzz in the streets around...
Jun 2025 • Family
The reality is that its a series of zebra crossings with very bright bill boards surrounding it and loads of people around. That said it was fun to see and worth a visit if you are heading to Tokyo just for the buzz in the streets around it, which is the bit we enjoyed most

Zebra crossing in all directions
Sep 2024 • Friends
Shibuya Crossing is one of the most known sightseeing points in Tokyo, the main city in Japan. In fact, it is a place, where some roads link and there are some zebra crossings and you can see, how a lot of people cross the roads in all directions. Really stress! All full of people! A curious place in a very modern city. Not more.
