Introduction to the Outlook Calendar
Applies To
We think you'll enjoy trying Microsoft 365

We're giving you a free trial of Outlook.

Click to unlock Outlook

Calendar is the calendar and scheduling component of Outlook that is fully integrated with email, contacts, and other features.

Just as you write in a notebook, you can select any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start typing. By using the Calendar you can create appointments and events, organize meetings, view group schedules, and much more.

Create appointments and events     

Select any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start to type to create your appointment or event. You can opt to have a sound or message remind you of appointments, meetings, and events, and you can color items for quick identification.

For more information, see Create or schedule an appointment and Create an event.

Organize meetings    

Select a time on the Calendar, create a meeting request, and select the people to invite. Outlook helps you find the earliest time when all the invitees are free. When you send the meeting request by email, the invitees receive the request in their Inbox. When the invitees open the request, they can accept, tentatively accept, or decline your meeting by selecting a single button. If your request conflicts with an item on the invitees' Calendar, Outlook displays a notification. If you, as the meeting organizer, allow this, invitees can propose an alternative meeting time. As the organizer, you can track who accepts or declines the request or who proposes another time for the meeting by opening the request.

For more information, see Schedule a meeting with other people.

View group schedules    

You can create calendars that show the schedules of a group of people or resources. For example, you can view the schedules of all the people in your department or all the resources, such as conference rooms, in your building. This helps you schedule meetings quickly.

View calendars side-by-side    

You can view side-by-side multiple calendars that you created and also calendars shared by other Outlook users. For example, you can create a separate calendar for your personal appointments and view both your work and personal calendars side-by-side.

For more information, see View multiple calendars at the same time.

You can also copy or move appointments between the displayed calendars. Use the Navigation Pane to quickly share your own calendar and open other shared calendars. Depending on the permissions granted by the owner of a calendar, you can simply view another person's calendar, or create appointments on shared calendars.

For more information, see Share and access a view-only calendar in Outlook and Share and access a calendar using edit or delegate permissions in Outlook.

View calendars on top of one another in overlay view     

You can use overlay view to display multiple calendars that you created and also calendars shared by other Outlook users. For example, you can create a separate calendar for your personal appointments and overlay your work and personal calendars to quickly see where you have conflicts or free time.

For more information, see View multiple calendars at the same time.

Link to calendars on Microsoft SharePoint sites    

If you have access to a SharePoint site, you can view the lists of events from that site in your Outlook Calendar. You can change the list in Outlook, even when you are working offline. The changes are automatically synchronized when you connect to the Internet again. Also, you can view the SharePoint calendars side-by-side with other personal or shared calendars.

Send calendars to anyone through email    

You can send your calendar to a mail recipient as an Internet Calendar, but keep control over how much information is shared. Your calendar information appears in the body of the email message as an Internet Calendar attachment that the recipient can open in Outlook.

For more information, see Introduction to calendar sharing.

Subscribe to Internet Calendars    

Internet Calendar Subscriptions resemble Internet Calendars, except that the downloaded calendar is synchronized regularly with the Internet Calendar and updated.

Manage another user's calendar    

With the Delegate Access feature, one person can use his or her own copy of Outlook to easily manage another person's calendar. For example, an administrative assistant can manage the calendar of a manager. When the manager designates the assistant as a delegate, the assistant can create, move, or delete appointments and can organize meetings on the manager's behalf.

For more information, see Manage another person's mail and calendar items.

Color categories in Outlook help you more easily recognize and organize related items. You can apply them to meetings, appointments, emails, notes, contacts, and more.

Once assigned, the color category indication appears within the individual item and also in collective table views (e.g., Inbox). If needed, you can assign multiple color categories to a single item. You can also customize the names and colors of your available color category set.

**Note:**If you apply a color category to a meeting or request that you've received from another person, the color category selection will not affect their Outlook view. Your category selections apply only to items within your calendar.

Select a tab option below for the version of Outlook you're using. What version of Outlook do I have?

Applies To
We think you'll enjoy trying Microsoft 365

We're giving you a free trial of Outlook.

Click to unlock Outlook

Calendar is the calendar and scheduling component of Outlook that is fully integrated with email, contacts, and other features.

Just as you write in a notebook, you can select any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start typing. By using the Calendar you can create appointments and events, organize meetings, view group schedules, and much more.

Create appointments and events     

Select any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start to type to create your appointment or event. You can opt to have a sound or message remind you of appointments, meetings, and events, and you can color items for quick identification.

For more information, see Create or schedule an appointment and Create an event.

Organize meetings    

Select a time on the Calendar, create a meeting request, and select the people to invite. Outlook helps you find the earliest time when all the invitees are free. When you send the meeting request by email, the invitees receive the request in their Inbox. When the invitees open the request, they can accept, tentatively accept, or decline your meeting by selecting a single button. If your request conflicts with an item on the invitees' Calendar, Outlook displays a notification. If you, as the meeting organizer, allow this, invitees can propose an alternative meeting time. As the organizer, you can track who accepts or declines the request or who proposes another time for the meeting by opening the request.

For more information, see Schedule a meeting with other people.

View group schedules    

You can create calendars that show the schedules of a group of people or resources. For example, you can view the schedules of all the people in your department or all the resources, such as conference rooms, in your building. This helps you schedule meetings quickly.

View calendars side-by-side    

You can view side-by-side multiple calendars that you created and also calendars shared by other Outlook users. For example, you can create a separate calendar for your personal appointments and view both your work and personal calendars side-by-side.

For more information, see View multiple calendars at the same time.

You can also copy or move appointments between the displayed calendars. Use the Navigation Pane to quickly share your own calendar and open other shared calendars. Depending on the permissions granted by the owner of a calendar, you can simply view another person's calendar, or create appointments on shared calendars.

For more information, see Share and access a view-only calendar in Outlook and Share and access a calendar using edit or delegate permissions in Outlook.

View calendars on top of one another in overlay view     

You can use overlay view to display multiple calendars that you created and also calendars shared by other Outlook users. For example, you can create a separate calendar for your personal appointments and overlay your work and personal calendars to quickly see where you have conflicts or free time.

For more information, see View multiple calendars at the same time.

Link to calendars on Microsoft SharePoint sites    

If you have access to a SharePoint site, you can view the lists of events from that site in your Outlook Calendar. You can change the list in Outlook, even when you are working offline. The changes are automatically synchronized when you connect to the Internet again. Also, you can view the SharePoint calendars side-by-side with other personal or shared calendars.

Send calendars to anyone through email    

You can send your calendar to a mail recipient as an Internet Calendar, but keep control over how much information is shared. Your calendar information appears in the body of the email message as an Internet Calendar attachment that the recipient can open in Outlook.

For more information, see Introduction to calendar sharing.

Subscribe to Internet Calendars    

Internet Calendar Subscriptions resemble Internet Calendars, except that the downloaded calendar is synchronized regularly with the Internet Calendar and updated.

Manage another user's calendar    

With the Delegate Access feature, one person can use his or her own copy of Outlook to easily manage another person's calendar. For example, an administrative assistant can manage the calendar of a manager. When the manager designates the assistant as a delegate, the assistant can create, move, or delete appointments and can organize meetings on the manager's behalf.

For more information, see Manage another person's mail and calendar items.

Color categories in Outlook help you more easily recognize and organize related items. You can apply them to meetings, appointments, emails, notes, contacts, and more.

Once assigned, the color category indication appears within the individual item and also in collective table views (e.g., Inbox). If needed, you can assign multiple color categories to a single item. You can also customize the names and colors of your available color category set.

**Note:**If you apply a color category to a meeting or request that you've received from another person, the color category selection will not affect their Outlook view. Your category selections apply only to items within your calendar.

Introduction to the Outlook Calendar
Applies To
We think you'll enjoy trying Microsoft 365

We're giving you a free trial of Outlook.

Click to unlock Outlook

Calendar is the calendar and scheduling component of Outlook that is fully integrated with email, contacts, and other features.

Just as you write in a notebook, you can select any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start typing. By using the Calendar you can create appointments and events, organize meetings, view group schedules, and much more.

Create appointments and events     

Select any time slot in the Outlook Calendar and start to type to create your appointment or event. You can opt to have a sound or message remind you of appointments, meetings, and events, and you can color items for quick identification.

For more information, see Create or schedule an appointment and Create an event.

Organize meetings    

Select a time on the Calendar, create a meeting request, and select the people to invite. Outlook helps you find the earliest time when all the invitees are free. When you send the meeting request by email, the invitees receive the request in their Inbox. When the invitees open the request, they can accept, tentatively accept, or decline your meeting by selecting a single button. If your request conflicts with an item on the invitees' Calendar, Outlook displays a notification. If you, as the meeting organizer, allow this, invitees can propose an alternative meeting time. As the organizer, you can track who accepts or declines the request or who proposes another time for the meeting by opening the request.

For more information, see Schedule a meeting with other people.

View group schedules    

You can create calendars that show the schedules of a group of people or resources. For example, you can view the schedules of all the people in your department or all the resources, such as conference rooms, in your building. This helps you schedule meetings quickly.

View calendars side-by-side    

You can view side-by-side multiple calendars that you created and also calendars shared by other Outlook users. For example, you can create a separate calendar for your personal appointments and view both your work and personal calendars side-by-side.

For more information, see View multiple calendars at the same time.

You can also copy or move appointments between the displayed calendars. Use the Navigation Pane to quickly share your own calendar and open other shared calendars. Depending on the permissions granted by the owner of a calendar, you can simply view another person's calendar, or create appointments on shared calendars.

For more information, see Share and access a view-only calendar in Outlook and Share and access a calendar using edit or delegate permissions in Outlook.

View calendars on top of one another in overlay view     

You can use overlay view to display multiple calendars that you created and also calendars shared by other Outlook users. For example, you can create a separate calendar for your personal appointments and overlay your work and personal calendars to quickly see where you have conflicts or free time.

For more information, see View multiple calendars at the same time.

Link to calendars on Microsoft SharePoint sites    

If you have access to a SharePoint site, you can view the lists of events from that site in your Outlook Calendar. You can change the list in Outlook, even when you are working offline. The changes are automatically synchronized when you connect to the Internet again. Also, you can view the SharePoint calendars side-by-side with other personal or shared calendars.

Send calendars to anyone through email    

You can send your calendar to a mail recipient as an Internet Calendar, but keep control over how much information is shared. Your calendar information appears in the body of the email message as an Internet Calendar attachment that the recipient can open in Outlook.

For more information, see Introduction to calendar sharing.

Subscribe to Internet Calendars    

Internet Calendar Subscriptions resemble Internet Calendars, except that the downloaded calendar is synchronized regularly with the Internet Calendar and updated.

Manage another user's calendar    

With the Delegate Access feature, one person can use his or her own copy of Outlook to easily manage another person's calendar. For example, an administrative assistant can manage the calendar of a manager. When the manager designates the assistant as a delegate, the assistant can create, move, or delete appointments and can organize meetings on the manager's behalf.

For more information, see Manage another person's mail and calendar items.

Color categories in Outlook help you more easily recognize and organize related items. You can apply them to meetings, appointments, emails, notes, contacts, and more.

Once assigned, the color category indication appears within the individual item and also in collective table views (e.g., Inbox). If needed, you can assign multiple color categories to a single item. You can also customize the names and colors of your available color category set.

**Note:**If you apply a color category to a meeting or request that you've received from another person, the color category selection will not affect their Outlook view. Your category selections apply only to items within your calendar.

Select a tab option below for the version of Outlook you're using. What version of Outlook do I have?

Color categories in Outlook help you more easily recognize and organize related items. You can apply them to meetings, appointments, emails, notes, contacts, and more.

Once assigned, the color category indication appears within the individual item and also in collective table views (e.g., Inbox). If needed, you can assign multiple color categories to a single item. You can also customize the names and colors of your available color category set.

**Note:**If you apply a color category to a meeting or request that you've received from another person, the color category selection will not affect their Outlook view. Your category selections apply only to items within your calendar.

Select a tab option below for the version of Outlook you're using. What version of Outlook do I have?

New OutlookClassic OutlookWeb

**Note:**If the steps under this **new Outlook** tab don't work, you may not be using new Outlook for Windows yet. Select the **[Classic Outlook](#picktab=classic_outlook)** tab and follow those steps instead.

### Add a category to a calendar event in new Outlook

1. Select **Calendar** ![Calendar icon](/images/en-us/2588e717-0915-41a7-9f51-72cf27ea02d7) from the navigation pane.
2. On your calendar, right-click a calendar event and select **Categorize**. Or, open the calendar item and from the ribbon under the **Event** tab, select **Categorize**.​​​​​​​

   The same listed categories are available for use on all Outlook item types, such as contacts and messages. If you don't find the category color that you want in the initially displayed list, select **All Categories**. There you'll see other category options and be able to create and assign new categories. See [Create and assign color categories in Outlook](/en-us/office/create-and-assign-color-categories-in-outlook-a1fde97e-15e1-4179-a1a0-8a91ef89b8dc).​​​​​​​

If you don't find the category color that you want in the initially displayed list, select **All Categories**. There you will see others and be able to create and assign new categories. See [Create and assign color categories in Outlook](/en-us/office/create-and-assign-color-categories-in-outlook-a1fde97e-15e1-4179-a1a0-8a91ef89b8dc).

### The Color Categories dialog box in classic Outlook

To see more categories or to create a new category, select **All Categories** in the drop-down list. This will open the **Color Categories** dialog box. To assign a color category select the associate check box. You can also assign multiple categories to a single item.

![Color Categories box](/images/en-us/cf9d5d85-fe99-4565-b4a7-4e1b803c8752)

Try these steps in order:

1. Refresh the page.
2. Clear your browser's [cache and cookies](/accounts/answer/32050).
3. Make sure [Javascript is turned on](/answer/23852).
4. Sign out of Google Calendar.
5. Close your browser.
6. Open your browser and sign in to Google Calendar again. Make sure to use "https" in the web address instead of "http."

If you're using a third-party app to sync your calendar, try turning off sync before signing back in again.

Why not showing ALL the kills at the replay from the player's POV? it takes only a while anyways and sometimes we miss nice shots just because u show only the ones that were shot by the winner of the round team and even sometimes not all of them.
