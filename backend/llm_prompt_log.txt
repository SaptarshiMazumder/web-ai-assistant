# Add tools

To handle queries that your chatbot can't answer "from memory", integrate a web search tool. The chatbot can use this tool to find relevant information and provide better responses.

Note

This tutorial builds on Build a basic chatbot.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

* An API key for the Tavily Search Engine.

## 1. Install the search engine

Install the requirements to use the Tavily Search Engine:

```
pip install -U langchain-tavily

```

## 2. Configure your environment

Configure your environment with your search engine API key:

```
import os

os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = "tvly-..."

```

## 3. Define the tool

Define the web search tool:

*API Reference: TavilySearch*

```
from langchain_tavily import TavilySearch

tool = TavilySearch(max_results=2)
tools = [tool]
tool.invoke("What's a 'node' in LangGraph?")

```

The results are page summaries our chat bot can use to answer questions:

```
{'query': "What's a 'node' in LangGraph?",
'follow_up_questions': None,
'answer': None,
'images': [],
'results': [{'title': "Introduction to LangGraph: A Beginner's Guide - Medium",

'response_time': 1.38}

```

## 4. Define the graph

For the `StateGraph` you created in the first tutorial, add `bind_tools` on the LLM. This lets the LLM know the correct JSON format to use if it wants to use the search engine.

Let's first select our LLM:

[OpenAI](#__tabbed_1_1)[Anthropic](#__tabbed_1_2)[Azure](#__tabbed_1_3)[Google Gemini](#__tabbed_1_4)[AWS Bedrock](#__tabbed_1_5)

```
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

llm = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4.1")

```

👉 Read the OpenAI integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[anthropic]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

llm = init_chat_model("anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

```

👉 Read the Anthropic integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = "..."
os.environ["OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2025-03-01-preview"

llm = init_chat_model(
    "azure_openai:gpt-4.1",
    azure_deployment=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],
)

```

👉 Read the Azure integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[google-genai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "..."

llm = init_chat_model("google_genai:gemini-2.0-flash")

```

👉 Read the Google GenAI integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[aws]"

```

```
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

# Follow the steps here to configure your credentials:
# 

llm = init_chat_model(
    "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0",
    model_provider="bedrock_converse",
)

```

👉 Read the AWS Bedrock integration docs

We can now incorporate it into a `StateGraph`:

*API Reference: StateGraph | START | END | add\_messages*

```
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Modification: tell the LLM which tools it can call
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

```

## 5. Create a function to run the tools

Now, create a function to run the tools if they are called. Do this by adding the tools to a new node called `BasicToolNode` that checks the most recent message in the state and calls tools if the message contains `tool_calls`. It relies on the LLM's `tool_calling` support, which is available in Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and a number of other LLM providers.

*API Reference: ToolMessage*

```
import json

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage

class BasicToolNode:
    """A node that runs the tools requested in the last AIMessage."""

    def __init__(self, tools: list) -> None:
        self.tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

    def __call__(self, inputs: dict):
        if messages := inputs.get("messages", []):
            message = messages[-1]
        else:
            raise ValueError("No message found in input")
        outputs = []
        for tool_call in message.tool_calls:
            tool_result = self.tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(
                tool_call["args"]
            )
            outputs.append(
                ToolMessage(
                    content=json.dumps(tool_result),
                    name=tool_call["name"],
                    tool_call_id=tool_call["id"],
                )
            )
        return {"messages": outputs}

tool_node = BasicToolNode(tools=[tool])
graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

```

Note

If you do not want to build this yourself in the future, you can use LangGraph's prebuilt ToolNode.

## 6. Define the `conditional_edges`

With the tool node added, now you can define the `conditional_edges`.

**Edges** route the control flow from one node to the next. **Conditional edges** start from a single node and usually contain "if" statements to route to different nodes depending on the current graph state. These functions receive the current graph `state` and return a string or list of strings indicating which node(s) to call next.

Next, define a router function called `route_tools` that checks for `tool_calls` in the chatbot's output. Provide this function to the graph by calling `add_conditional_edges`, which tells the graph that whenever the `chatbot` node completes to check this function to see where to go next.

The condition will route to `tools` if tool calls are present and `END` if not. Because the condition can return `END`, you do not need to explicitly set a `finish_point` this time.

```
def route_tools(
    state: State,
):
    """
    Use in the conditional_edge to route to the ToolNode if the last message
    has tool calls. Otherwise, route to the end.
    """
    if isinstance(state, list):
        ai_message = state[-1]
    elif messages := state.get("messages", []):
        ai_message = messages[-1]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"No messages found in input state to tool_edge: {state}")
    if hasattr(ai_message, "tool_calls") and len(ai_message.tool_calls) > 0:
        return "tools"
    return END

# The `tools_condition` function returns "tools" if the chatbot asks to use a tool, and "END" if
# it is fine directly responding. This conditional routing defines the main agent loop.
graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "chatbot",
    route_tools,
    # The following dictionary lets you tell the graph to interpret the condition's outputs as a specific node
    # It defaults to the identity function, but if you
    # want to use a node named something else apart from "tools",
    # You can update the value of the dictionary to something else
    # e.g., "tools": "my_tools"
    {"tools": "tools", END: END},
)
# Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph = graph_builder.compile()

```

Note

You can replace this with the prebuilt tools\_condition to be more concise.

## 7. Visualize the graph (optional)

You can visualize the graph using the `get_graph` method and one of the "draw" methods, like `draw_ascii` or `draw_png`. The `draw` methods each require additional dependencies.

```
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

```

!chatbot-with-tools-diagram

## 8. Ask the bot questions

Now you can ask the chatbot questions outside its training data:

```
def stream_graph_updates(user_input: str):
    for event in graph.stream({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]}):
        for value in event.values():
            print("Assistant:", value["messages"][-1].content)

while True:
    try:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit", "q"]:
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
    except:
        # fallback if input() is not available
        user_input = "What do you know about LangGraph?"
        print("User: " + user_input)
        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
        break

```

```

**Congratulations!** You've created a conversational agent in LangGraph that can use a search engine to retrieve updated information when needed. Now it can handle a wider range of user queries.

To inspect all the steps your agent just took, check out this LangSmith trace.

## Next steps

The chatbot cannot remember past interactions on its own, which limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the next part, you will add **memory** to address this.

CONTENT:
# LangGraph quickstart

This guide shows you how to set up and use LangGraph's **prebuilt**, **reusable** components, which are designed to help you construct agentic systems quickly and reliably.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

* An Anthropic API key

## 1. Install dependencies

If you haven't already, install LangGraph and LangChain:

```
pip install -U langgraph "langchain[anthropic]"

```

Info

`langchain[anthropic]` is installed so the agent can call the model.

## 2. Create an agent

To create an agent, use `create_react_agent`:

*API Reference: create\_react\_agent*

```
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:  
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",  
    tools=[get_weather],  
    prompt="You are a helpful assistant"  
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)

```

## 3. Configure an LLM

To configure an LLM with specific parameters, such as temperature, use init\_chat\_model:

*API Reference: init\_chat\_model | create\_react\_agent*

```
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

model = init_chat_model(
    "anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    temperature=0
)

agent = create_react_agent(
    model=model,
    tools=[get_weather],
)

```

For more information on how to configure LLMs, see Models.

## 4. Add a custom prompt

Prompts instruct the LLM how to behave. Add one of the following types of prompts:

* **Static**: A string is interpreted as a **system message**.
* **Dynamic**: A list of messages generated at **runtime**, based on input or configuration.

[Static prompt](#__tabbed_1_1)[Dynamic prompt](#__tabbed_1_2)

Define a fixed prompt string or list of messages:

```
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    # A static prompt that never changes
    prompt="Never answer questions about the weather."
)

agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)

```

Define a function that returns a message list based on the agent's state and configuration:

```
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor import AgentState
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def prompt(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig) -> list[AnyMessage]:  
    user_name = config["configurable"].get("user_name")
    system_msg = f"You are a helpful assistant. Address the user as {user_name}."
    return [{"role": "system", "content": system_msg}] + state["messages"]

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    prompt=prompt
)

agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]},
    config={"configurable": {"user_name": "John Smith"}}
)

```

1. Dynamic prompts allow including non-message context when constructing an input to the LLM, such as:

   * Information passed at runtime, like a `user_id` or API credentials (using `config`).
   * Internal agent state updated during a multi-step reasoning process (using `state`).

   Dynamic prompts can be defined as functions that take `state` and `config` and return a list of messages to send to the LLM.

For more information, see Context.

## 5. Add memory

To allow multi-turn conversations with an agent, you need to enable persistence by providing a checkpointer when creating an agent. At runtime, you need to provide a config containing `thread_id` — a unique identifier for the conversation (session):

*API Reference: create\_react\_agent | InMemorySaver*

```
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    checkpointer=checkpointer  
)

# Run the agent
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
sf_response = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]},
    config  
)
ny_response = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what about new york?"}]},
    config
)

```

When you enable the checkpointer, it stores agent state at every step in the provided checkpointer database (or in memory, if using `InMemorySaver`).

Note that in the above example, when the agent is invoked the second time with the same `thread_id`, the original message history from the first conversation is automatically included, together with the new user input.

For more information, see Memory.

## 6. Configure structured output

To produce structured responses conforming to a schema, use the `response_format` parameter. The schema can be defined with a `Pydantic` model or `TypedDict`. The result will be accessible via the `structured_response` field.

*API Reference: create\_react\_agent*

```
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

class WeatherResponse(BaseModel):
    conditions: str

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    response_format=WeatherResponse  
)

response = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)

response["structured_response"]

```

LLM post-processing

Structured output requires an additional call to the LLM to format the response according to the schema.

# Add tools

To handle queries that your chatbot can't answer "from memory", integrate a web search tool. The chatbot can use this tool to find relevant information and provide better responses.

Note

This tutorial builds on Build a basic chatbot.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

* An API key for the Tavily Search Engine.

## 1. Install the search engine

Install the requirements to use the Tavily Search Engine:

```
pip install -U langchain-tavily

```

## 2. Configure your environment

Configure your environment with your search engine API key:

```
import os

os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = "tvly-..."

```

## 3. Define the tool

Define the web search tool:

*API Reference: TavilySearch*

```
from langchain_tavily import TavilySearch

tool = TavilySearch(max_results=2)
tools = [tool]
tool.invoke("What's a 'node' in LangGraph?")

```

The results are page summaries our chat bot can use to answer questions:

```
{'query': "What's a 'node' in LangGraph?",
'follow_up_questions': None,
'answer': None,
'images': [],
'results': [{'title': "Introduction to LangGraph: A Beginner's Guide - Medium",

'response_time': 1.38}

```

## 4. Define the graph

For the `StateGraph` you created in the first tutorial, add `bind_tools` on the LLM. This lets the LLM know the correct JSON format to use if it wants to use the search engine.

Let's first select our LLM:

[OpenAI](#__tabbed_1_1)[Anthropic](#__tabbed_1_2)[Azure](#__tabbed_1_3)[Google Gemini](#__tabbed_1_4)[AWS Bedrock](#__tabbed_1_5)

```
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

llm = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4.1")

```

👉 Read the OpenAI integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[anthropic]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

llm = init_chat_model("anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

```

👉 Read the Anthropic integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = "..."
os.environ["OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2025-03-01-preview"

llm = init_chat_model(
    "azure_openai:gpt-4.1",
    azure_deployment=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],
)

```

👉 Read the Azure integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[google-genai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "..."

llm = init_chat_model("google_genai:gemini-2.0-flash")

```

👉 Read the Google GenAI integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[aws]"

```

```
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

# Follow the steps here to configure your credentials:
# 

llm = init_chat_model(
    "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0",
    model_provider="bedrock_converse",
)

```

👉 Read the AWS Bedrock integration docs

We can now incorporate it into a `StateGraph`:

*API Reference: StateGraph | START | END | add\_messages*

```
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Modification: tell the LLM which tools it can call
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

```

## 5. Create a function to run the tools

Now, create a function to run the tools if they are called. Do this by adding the tools to a new node called `BasicToolNode` that checks the most recent message in the state and calls tools if the message contains `tool_calls`. It relies on the LLM's `tool_calling` support, which is available in Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and a number of other LLM providers.

*API Reference: ToolMessage*

```
import json

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage

class BasicToolNode:
    """A node that runs the tools requested in the last AIMessage."""

    def __init__(self, tools: list) -> None:
        self.tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

    def __call__(self, inputs: dict):
        if messages := inputs.get("messages", []):
            message = messages[-1]
        else:
            raise ValueError("No message found in input")
        outputs = []
        for tool_call in message.tool_calls:
            tool_result = self.tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(
                tool_call["args"]
            )
            outputs.append(
                ToolMessage(
                    content=json.dumps(tool_result),
                    name=tool_call["name"],
                    tool_call_id=tool_call["id"],
                )
            )
        return {"messages": outputs}

tool_node = BasicToolNode(tools=[tool])
graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

```

Note

If you do not want to build this yourself in the future, you can use LangGraph's prebuilt ToolNode.

## 6. Define the `conditional_edges`

With the tool node added, now you can define the `conditional_edges`.

**Edges** route the control flow from one node to the next. **Conditional edges** start from a single node and usually contain "if" statements to route to different nodes depending on the current graph state. These functions receive the current graph `state` and return a string or list of strings indicating which node(s) to call next.

Next, define a router function called `route_tools` that checks for `tool_calls` in the chatbot's output. Provide this function to the graph by calling `add_conditional_edges`, which tells the graph that whenever the `chatbot` node completes to check this function to see where to go next.

The condition will route to `tools` if tool calls are present and `END` if not. Because the condition can return `END`, you do not need to explicitly set a `finish_point` this time.

```
def route_tools(
    state: State,
):
    """
    Use in the conditional_edge to route to the ToolNode if the last message
    has tool calls. Otherwise, route to the end.
    """
    if isinstance(state, list):
        ai_message = state[-1]
    elif messages := state.get("messages", []):
        ai_message = messages[-1]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"No messages found in input state to tool_edge: {state}")
    if hasattr(ai_message, "tool_calls") and len(ai_message.tool_calls) > 0:
        return "tools"
    return END

# The `tools_condition` function returns "tools" if the chatbot asks to use a tool, and "END" if
# it is fine directly responding. This conditional routing defines the main agent loop.
graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "chatbot",
    route_tools,
    # The following dictionary lets you tell the graph to interpret the condition's outputs as a specific node
    # It defaults to the identity function, but if you
    # want to use a node named something else apart from "tools",
    # You can update the value of the dictionary to something else
    # e.g., "tools": "my_tools"
    {"tools": "tools", END: END},
)
# Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph = graph_builder.compile()

```

Note

You can replace this with the prebuilt tools\_condition to be more concise.

## 7. Visualize the graph (optional)

You can visualize the graph using the `get_graph` method and one of the "draw" methods, like `draw_ascii` or `draw_png`. The `draw` methods each require additional dependencies.

```
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

```

!chatbot-with-tools-diagram

## 8. Ask the bot questions

Now you can ask the chatbot questions outside its training data:

```
def stream_graph_updates(user_input: str):
    for event in graph.stream({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]}):
        for value in event.values():
            print("Assistant:", value["messages"][-1].content)

while True:
    try:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit", "q"]:
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
    except:
        # fallback if input() is not available
        user_input = "What do you know about LangGraph?"
        print("User: " + user_input)
        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
        break

```

```

```

**Congratulations!** You've created a conversational agent in LangGraph that can use a search engine to retrieve updated information when needed. Now it can handle a wider range of user queries.

To inspect all the steps your agent just took, check out this LangSmith trace.

## Next steps

The chatbot cannot remember past interactions on its own, which limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the next part, you will add **memory** to address this.

# Workflows and Agents

This guide reviews common patterns for agentic systems. In describing these systems, it can be useful to make a distinction between "workflows" and "agents". One way to think about this difference is nicely explained in Anthropic's `Building Effective Agents` blog post:

> Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
> Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

Here is a simple way to visualize these differences:

!Agent Workflow

When building agents and workflows, LangGraph offers a number of benefits including persistence, streaming, and support for debugging as well as deployment.

## Set up

You can use any chat model that supports structured outputs and tool calling. Below, we show the process of installing the packages, setting API keys, and testing structured outputs / tool calling for Anthropic.

Install dependencies

```
pip install langchain_core langchain-anthropic langgraph

```

Initialize an LLM

*API Reference: ChatAnthropic*

```
import os
import getpass

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

```

## Building Blocks: The Augmented LLM

LLM have augmentations that support building workflows and agents. These include structured outputs and tool calling, as shown in this image from the Anthropic blog on `Building Effective Agents`:

!augmented_llm.png

```
# Schema for structured output
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class SearchQuery(BaseModel):
    search_query: str = Field(None, description="Query that is optimized web search.")
    justification: str = Field(
        None, description="Why this query is relevant to the user's request."
    )

# Augment the LLM with schema for structured output
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(SearchQuery)

# Invoke the augmented LLM
output = structured_llm.invoke("How does Calcium CT score relate to high cholesterol?")

# Define a tool
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a * b

# Augment the LLM with tools
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([multiply])

# Invoke the LLM with input that triggers the tool call
msg = llm_with_tools.invoke("What is 2 times 3?")

# Get the tool call
msg.tool_calls

```

## Prompt chaining

In prompt chaining, each LLM call processes the output of the previous one.

As noted in the Anthropic blog on `Building Effective Agents`:

> Prompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. You can add programmatic checks (see "gate" in the diagram below) on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process is still on track.
>
> When to use this workflow: This workflow is ideal for situations where the task can be easily and cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks. The main goal is to trade off latency for higher accuracy, by making each LLM call an easier task.

## Parallelization

With parallelization, LLMs work simultaneously on a task:

> LLMs can sometimes work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. This workflow, parallelization, manifests in two key variations: Sectioning: Breaking a task into independent subtasks run in parallel. Voting: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse outputs.
>
> When to use this workflow: Parallelization is effective when the divided subtasks can be parallelized for speed, or when multiple perspectives or attempts are needed for higher confidence results. For complex tasks with multiple considerations, LLMs generally perform better when each consideration is handled by a separate LLM call, allowing focused attention on each specific aspect.

## Routing

Routing classifies an input and directs it to a followup task. As noted in the Anthropic blog on `Building Effective Agents`:

> Routing classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This workflow allows for separation of concerns, and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow, optimizing for one kind of input can hurt performance on other inputs.
>
> When to use this workflow: Routing works well for complex tasks where there are distinct categories that are better handled separately, and where classification can be handled accurately, either by an LLM or a more traditional classification model/algorithm.

## Orchestrator-Worker

With orchestrator-worker, an orchestrator breaks down a task and delegates each sub-task to workers. As noted in the Anthropic blog on `Building Effective Agents`:

> In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.
>
> When to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can't predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). Whereas it's topographically similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibility—subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input.

from typing import Annotated, List
import operator

# Schema for structured output to use in planning

    description: str = Field(
        description="Brief overview of the main topics and concepts to be covered in this section.",

        description="Sections of the report.",
    )

# Augment the LLM with schema for structured output
planner = llm.with_structured_output(Sections)

```

**Creating Workers in LangGraph**

Because orchestrator-worker workflows are common, LangGraph **has the `Send` API to support this**. It lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send each one a specific input. Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a *shared state key* that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output. As you can see below, we iterate over a list of sections and `Send` each to a worker node. See further documentation here and here.

```
from langgraph.types import Send

# Graph state
class State(TypedDict):
    topic: str  # Report topic
    sections: list[Section]  # List of report sections
    completed_sections: Annotated[
        list, operator.add
    ]  # All workers write to this key in parallel
    final_report: str  # Final report

# Worker state
class WorkerState(TypedDict):
    section: Section
    completed_sections: Annotated[list, operator.add]

# Nodes
def orchestrator(state: State):
    """Orchestrator that generates a plan for the report"""

    # Generate queries

## Evaluator-optimizer

In the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop:

> When to use this workflow: This workflow is particularly effective when we have clear evaluation criteria, and when iterative refinement provides measurable value. The two signs of good fit are, first, that LLM responses can be demonstrably improved when a human articulates their feedback; and second, that the LLM can provide such feedback. This is analogous to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through when producing a polished document.

## Agent

Agents are typically implemented as an LLM performing actions (via tool-calling) based on environmental feedback in a loop. As noted in the Anthropic blog on `Building Effective Agents`:

> Agents can handle sophisticated tasks, but their implementation is often straightforward. They are typically just LLMs using tools based on environmental feedback in a loop. It is therefore crucial to design toolsets and their documentation clearly and thoughtfully.
>
> When to use agents: Agents can be used for open-ended problems where it's difficult or impossible to predict the required number of steps, and where you can't hardcode a fixed path. The LLM will potentially operate for many turns, and you must have some level of trust in its decision-making. Agents' autonomy makes them ideal for scaling tasks in trusted environments.

messages = pre_built_agent.invoke({"messages": messages})
for m in messages["messages"]:
    m.pretty_print()

```

## What LangGraph provides

By constructing each of the above in LangGraph, we get a few things:

### Persistence: Human-in-the-Loop

LangGraph persistence layer supports interruption and approval of actions (e.g., Human In The Loop). See Module 3 of LangChain Academy.

### Persistence: Memory

LangGraph persistence layer supports conversational (short-term) memory and long-term memory. See Modules 2 and 5 of LangChain Academy:

### Streaming

LangGraph provides several ways to stream workflow / agent outputs or intermediate state. See Module 3 of LangChain Academy.

### Deployment

LangGraph provides an easy on-ramp for deployment, observability, and evaluation. See module 6 of LangChain Academy.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers can easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

See [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019) for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers can easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

See [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019) for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

To choose who can record and transcribe:

## New calendar

2. Select an event and select **Edit** ![Edit icon](/images/en-us/073d9d9a-0d84-402f-acdb-5765e790261f)> **More options**.
3. In **Event**, select **Meeting options**  ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e).

3. Select **Edit**.

5. In **Recording and transcription** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)​​​​​​​, choose your preference in the **Who can record and transcribe** dropdown menu.
6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

Using only the current webpage content below, answer the user's question by quoting the relevant passage, code block, or table WORD-FOR-WORD, including ALL formatting, indentation, and line breaks. DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or shorten ANY part of the quoted answer, unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize giving the most detailed answer possible by quoting the all relevant text from the content. If the content has numbers, prices, code, tables, or other specific details, quote them exactly as they appear. If multiple relevant passages are found, include ALL of them in their entirety, word-for-word. ALWAYS provide which page they should visit to find the exact information they are looking for, if possible, by saying 'Please visit [page URL] for the full details.' If you cite information from a source, always include the full URL shown in the source.If no answer is found, summarize anything related, and politely inform the user that the answer does not appear to be present, suggest a related page by URL if present in the content. Do not hallucinate.At the end, write 'SUFFICIENT: YES' if the answer fully resolves the question, or 'SUFFICIENT: NO' if not.

### Start a live transcription

When you [record a meeting](/en-us/office/record-a-meeting-in-microsoft-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24), transcription starts automatically.

Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### Change transcription language

To ensure transcription accuracy, make sure the meeting spoken language reflects the language everyone is speaking.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To change the transcription language:

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Mobile
Change your background
Before a meeting

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

If multiple relevant passages are found, include ALL of them in their entirety, word-for-word. ALWAYS provide which page they should visit to find the exact information they are looking for, if possible, by saying 'Please visit [page URL] for the full details.' If you cite information from a source, always include the full URL shown in the source.If no answer is found, summarize anything related, and politely inform the user that the answer does not appear to be present, suggest a related page by URL if present in the content. Do not hallucinate.At the end, write 'SUFFICIENT: YES' if the answer fully resolves the question, or 'SUFFICIENT: NO' if not.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Mobile
Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Select Video effects.

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed.

Select Add new  to upload and use an image from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

Select Preview to view the background before you apply it.

Select Apply.

Notes: 

Linux users aren't able to use this feature.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

### Who can start, stop, view, and download a transcript?

With Teams Premium and Copilot, meeting organizers can manage recording and transcribing permissions when they schedule Teams meetings.

There are three options for who can record and transcribe a meeting:

* Organizers and co-organizers
* Organizers, co-organizers and presenters
* No one

For info about organizer and presenter roles, see [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

| Type of meeting participant | Start and stop transcription | View real-time transcription | View transcript after meeting | Download transcript after meeting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Organizer | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Person from same organization | Yes | Yes | Yes | No, but organizers can configure who can download on Stream. |
| Person from another tenant | No | Yes | No | No |
| Anonymous | No | No | No | No |

People who call into a meeting can't view the transcript.

**Notes:**

* Teams live transcripts for meetings with recording and/or transcription are stored in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business. The transcript can be accessed through the meeting chat and **Recap** tab in Teams until a meeting organizer deletes the transcript.
* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers can easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

See [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019) for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

To choose who can record and transcribe:

6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Select Video effects.

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed.

Select Preview to view the background before you apply it.

Select Apply.

Notes: 

Linux users aren't able to use this feature.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

### Start a live transcription

When you [record a meeting](/en-us/office/record-a-meeting-in-microsoft-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24), transcription starts automatically.

To start a live transcription only:

1. Select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c) in your meeting controls.

3. Confirm the language everyone is speaking in the meeting.
4. Select **Confirm**.

​​​​​​​All participants see a notification that the meeting is being transcribed. Participants can choose to [hide their identities in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).

Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### Change transcription language

To ensure transcription accuracy, make sure the meeting spoken language reflects the language everyone is speaking.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To change the transcription language:

1. Select **More actions**  ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c) in your meeting controls.
2. Hover over **Record and transcribe**  ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
3. Select **Show transcript**  ![Start transcription icon in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/50689f70-1f91-43ea-aa68-dfa88cb7476c).
4. In the transcript pane, select **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff)​​​​​​​.
5. In **Meeting spoken language**, select the language people are speaking.
6. Select **Update**. The transcript will now display in this language.

**Notes:**

* To use this feature, the event must be at least transcribed. For the best recap experience, record and transcribe the event.
* AI summaries might look different based on the event's transcription language. This is due to differences in AI language models. We're continuing to improve these features.

After a transcribed or recorded event ends, you can access its recap from the event chat or Teams calendar event.

To access a recap from chat, open the event chat and tap **Apps** > **Recap**. You can also open the recap by tapping the recording or transcript thumbnail.

To view the recap in other events within a series, tap the series invite in your Teams calendar and tap **Apps** > **Recap**. Then, tap the date and time of the event you want to review.

**Notes:**

* Recap doesn’t currently support PSTN calls in Teams.
* Recap notifications, notes, and content aren’t currently available for ad-hoc events and calls.

## Intelligent recap

Get a more personalized rundown of your events with intelligent recap. Save time reviewing with AI-powered features that take you right to the moments you’re looking for. Intelligent recaps for webinars and town halls can be accessed by event organizers, co-organizers, and presenters.

**Notes:**

* Intelligent recap is available as part of [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams events more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to Teams Premium, contact your IT admin.
* Intelligent recap is also available as part of the Microsoft 365 Copilot license.

### Supported languages

Many languages are supported in intelligent recap. For more info, see [Supported languages for Microsoft 365 Copilot](/en-us/office/supported-languages-for-microsoft-365-copilot-94518d61-644b-4118-9492-617eea4801d8). If your event's spoken and transcribed languages are supported, all AI features will be available in Teams Premium.

**Important:**AI-generated content is based on the event transcript and is powered by GPT and other AI models. The AI-generated content may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. Microsoft constantly works to improve the technology in reducing these cases.

## Recording

If you record an event, the recording will be available in the event recap after the event ends. You can tap between tabs to review different elements of the recording.

Tap the full screen icon for a more immersive viewing experience.

## AI notes

View manual and AI-generated notes and follow-up tasks from an event by selecting AI notes. AI notes are available for events that lasted longer than five minutes and were transcribed in English.

To see AI notes in a recap, tap **AI notes**.

![View AI generated notes in Teams meeting recap.](/images/en-us/2b989f23-cb58-4a41-a6f8-c066c4a64d07)

**Notes:**

* To use this feature, the event must be transcribed.
* Due to differences in AI language models, AI notes might be formatted differently, depending on event transcription language. We are continuing to improve these features.

## Mentions

Mentions are parts of an event when your name was mentioned by someone else.

To see mentions of your name in an event recap, tap **@ Mentions**. You'll see all the instances when your name was spoken, as well as a timestamp of when the mention occurred.

![View name mentions in Teams meeting recap.](/images/en-us/65989995-6e82-496f-a233-b9a6836d2dfd)

**Notes:**

* To use name mention markers, the event must be transcribed.
* Name mentions only work if someone's name in the transcription matches their display name.

## Content

In an event recap, tap **Content** to see all files from the event. You'll be able to view files that were attached to the event, shared in chat, or related to the event.

![View shared content in Teams meeting recap.](/images/en-us/6ee2fac3-b6d9-4356-ae1b-56867c9b52fa)

## Speakers

The **Speakers** view is an AI-powered feature that helps you quickly find specific speakers and their main points in an event recording. Tap **Speakers** to see who spoke and when. Tap someone’s speaker bar to watch when they spoke during the event.

![View speakers in the Teams meeting recap.](/images/en-us/1d1f7d92-76ba-476b-98e0-05f2edc3c793)

**Note:**To use this feature, the event must be transcribed.

## Copilot

## FAQ

### What data does Teams use to provide Intelligent recap?

Teams uses the event transcript, attendance data, and PPT Live data to provide AI-powered features in Intelligent Recap.

### Does Teams store any event data?

Teams stores event data but Microsoft doesn’t have access to it. How it’s stored depends on policies set by your IT admin. Your event data is stored in the geographic region associated with your organization. Recordings are stored in OneDrive and SharePoint, in accordance with the Microsoft Purview policy. Learn more about managing your SharePoint governance here.

### Do AI-generated notes and AI-generated tasks expire?

AI-generated notes and AI-generated tasks will expire according to your org’s policies. For more information, contact your IT admin.

### Who can access an events' intelligent recap?

People in your org can access an event's intelligent recap if they were invited to the event. Anyone who wasn't invited or isn't in your org won't have access, even if they have the recording link or Teams Premium.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers can easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

See [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019) for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

To choose who can record and transcribe:

6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

CONTENT:
As the folks who build Teams, we spend a lot of time learning about how you work and building a product to help.

So, in this series, *Teams tips from the experts*, we're going to share how we use Teams. Think of it as a productivity guide full of tips and tricks for using Microsoft Teams at work. And we won't just be sharing glory stories and great gifs (although there are plenty of great gifs) — we'll talk about where we got stuck, too, and how we got past it.

Hopefully, our experiences can help you find ways that Teams can complement your work.

> Different teams use Teams differently, but on the Teams team (say that five times fast), this is how we do it.

But keep in mind that, like a hammer or a computer chip, Teams is a tool. The way our team uses it to build Teams may not be the same way another team would use it to run a hospital or bank. It’s probably not even the same way another group of people would build great productivity software. And that's OK.

Different teams use Teams differently, but on the Teams team (say that five times fast), this is how we do it.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Desktop
Mobile
Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Select Video effects.

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed.

Select Add new  to upload and use an image from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

Select Preview to view the background before you apply it.

Select Apply.

Notes: 

Linux users aren't able to use this feature.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

Each image comes with a brief description, allowing you to learn more about the location or subject featured in the photo. The Bing Wallpaper app is easy to install and use, providing a seamless way to keep your desktop visually engaging and informative.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### Change transcription language

To ensure transcription accuracy, make sure the meeting spoken language reflects the language everyone is speaking.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To change the transcription language:

1. Select **More actions**  ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c) in your meeting controls.

5. In **Meeting spoken language**, select the language people are speaking.
6. Select **Update**. The transcript will now display in this language.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

### Start a live transcription

When you [record a meeting](/en-us/office/record-a-meeting-in-microsoft-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24), transcription starts automatically.

To start a live transcription only:

1. Select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c) in your meeting controls.
2. Select **Record and transcribe**  ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e) > **Start transcription**  ![Start transcription icon in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/50689f70-1f91-43ea-aa68-dfa88cb7476c).
3. Confirm the language everyone is speaking in the meeting.
4. Select **Confirm**.

​​​​​​​All participants see a notification that the meeting is being transcribed. Participants can choose to [hide their identities in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).

Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### Change transcription language

To ensure transcription accuracy, make sure the meeting spoken language reflects the language everyone is speaking.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

* No one

For info about organizer and presenter roles, see [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

**Notes:**

* Teams live transcripts for meetings with recording and/or transcription are stored in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business. The transcript can be accessed through the meeting chat and **Recap** tab in Teams until a meeting organizer deletes the transcript.
* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers can easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

**Important:**AI-generated content is based on the event transcript and is powered by GPT and other AI models. Some AI-generated content might be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. Microsoft constantly works to improve the technology that reduces these cases.

## Timeline markers

Timeline markers appear along a recording’s progress bar and show the parts most relevant to you. View timeline markers by hovering over an event recording. Select one to go right to that part of the recording.  
  
![View of meeting recap in Teams](/images/en-us/49a02028-a7b2-4c5e-a19f-42c04d755c1e)  
  
Timeline markers include:  
  
**Name mention markers**  
Go right to a part of a recording when someone said your name with name mention timeline markers. When you play an event recording, you can see if your name was mentioned by hovering over the timeline.

If your name was mentioned, you’ll see the **@** icon. Select the **@** icon to jump right to that part of the recording. You can also view a transcription of what was said and who said it by opening the transcript pane. Only you can see your own name mention markers.

![View of meeting recap in Teams](/images/en-us/81e9184e-bba0-4a88-9e92-42637941737f)

**Notes:**

* To use name mention markers, your event must be recorded or transcribed.
* Name mentions only work if someone's name in the transcription matches their display name.

**Join and leave markers**
  
Join and leave markers show when you joined and left an event. When you play an event recording, hover over the timeline to see when you joined or left. Select the **Join**  ![Teams add member to chat](/images/en-us/e8aab209-8f29-48c1-a23c-35d2547933df) or **Leave**  ![Teams leave chat icon](/images/en-us/5c7325f0-edb3-4edb-936e-0e6de7ec48ee) marker to go to that part of the recording. Only you can see your own join and leave markers.

**Screen share markers**

Review presentations or other shared content with screen share markers. Screen share markers ![Teams share screen icon](/images/en-us/8f5e42a7-b0ef-4a42-9651-d09d6160f525) show when someone shared their screen.

Hover over the recording timeline to see screen share markers.  Select the marker to go to that part of the recording.

## AI summary

View AI-generated notes and follow-up tasks from an event by selecting **AI summary**. AI summaries are available for events transcribed in a supported language. The event must also be five minutes or longer in duration.

![View of meeting recap in Teams](/images/en-us/9ba52e54-3c98-49e1-9141-81f99b7df272)

You might not be able to copy an AI summary if the event's sensitivity label prevents it.

**Notes:**

* To use this feature, the event must be at least transcribed. For the best recap experience, record and transcribe the event.
* AI summaries might look different based on the event's transcription language. This is due to differences in AI language models. We're continuing to improve these features.

### Share AI summary

Share AI summaries from intelligent recap with participants, including those outside your org, by generating an Outlook email right from the event recap. The email will draft automatically and include a meeting summary and follow-up tasks.

To send a recap email:

1. Select **Calendar** ![Teams Calendar tab icon](/images/en-us/2975b9cc-8d8c-4cec-8585-63cadfca9b49) in Teams.
2. Open the past event details.
3. Select **Recap**.
4. Select **Share** ![OD share icon](/images/en-us/fd2fa2f3-5f89-4f89-b258-3b641dd53c4b) > **Share to Outlook** ![Teams get mail address icon](/images/en-us/f97fd681-f826-4dc9-b98a-b0fe1398fbdf).
5. Edit the drafted email for accuracy.

   * The email recipients will be people invited to the event. Add or remove recipients in the **To** field before sending.
6. When the email is ready, select **Send**.

The email will send from the email address of the person who initiated it. Meeting organizers, co-organizers, and presenters can initiate recap emails in Teams.

**Important:**

* Sharing AI summaries isn't available if:
* The sensitivity label of the meeting is set to **Confidential Recipients Only** or **Highly Confidential Recipients Only**.

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.

## FAQ

### Why is my meeting recording automatically if I didn’t schedule it that way?

* If you schedule a meeting or event using the town hall or webinar template, automatic recording and transcription will be on by default.   
    
  To turn off automatic recording before the meeting or event starts, open the event details in your Teams calendar and select **Meeting options**  ![Settings icon](/images/en-us/e2a1f329-d95b-7d5e-181c-7c3e12fd9321) > **Recording & transcription** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

### Where is my recording?

If you can’t find a recording:

* Check if there is a message indicating that your recording started. If you don’t see this message, the recording most likely didn’t start and can’t be recovered.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a recording start notification.](/images/en-us/dc21305a-252b-4f92-8b1a-e733b250e474)

  ![Screenshot of a recording chiclet that indicated the recording upload failed.](/images/en-us/e2fbb734-95a5-464a-9a35-a3afd9245f14)

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers can easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

See [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019) for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

## Live c​​​​​​​aptions in Teams

Teams can detect what’s said in a meeting and present real-time captions. If you're using the desktop app for Windows or Mac, there are also several caption customization options.

**Notes:**

* People can choose not to be identified in captions. For details, see [Hide your identity in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).
* Teams doesn't save captions. If you'd like a transcript of the meeting, turn on transcription. You'll be able to download the transcript after the meeting.

There are a couple ways to get live captions in Teams:

* From the built-in captioning provided by Teams
* From a Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART) captioner. To learn how to use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting, refer to [Use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting (human generated captions)](/en-us/office/use-cart-captions-in-a-microsoft-teams-meeting-human-generated-captions-2dd889e8-32a8-4582-98b8-6c96cf14eb47).

## Live caption settings

Teams has built-in closed captioning you can turn on from the meeting controls.

### Turn captions on and off

* To use live captions in a meeting, go to your meeting controls at the top of the screen and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Show live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).
* To stop using live captions, go to your meeting controls and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Hide live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).

### Change the spoken language

Set a meeting’s spoken language to the language people are speaking for more accurate captions.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To access the meeting spoken language settings:

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
2. In the **Meeting spoken language** dropdown menu, select the language everyone is speaking from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Update** to change.

**Important:**For other participants to access the meeting spoken language, transcription must be turned off. If there’s an ongoing transcription, they must first turn it off or turn off the feature that started the transcription. Then, they must manually turn transcription on again.

## Set up live translated captions in an event

In town halls and live events, organizers preselect which languages attendees can see live captions in. Organizers can select six languages, or ten if they have Premium, from over 50 different languages.

### To set up live translated captions in an event:

1. Open the event in your Teams calendar.
2. In **Details**, select **Meeting options** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e).
3. In **Engagement**​​​​​​​  ![Teams Chat Tab icon](/images/en-us/3c2a24f3-7e8f-4419-8c78-16c5a795d45f) > **Translate attendee captions**, select the languages that live translated captions will be available in during your event.  
     
   ![Meeting option showing how to add languages for live translated captions in an event.](/images/en-us/7249ee23-9636-4844-b2a0-f0dae56359f7)
4. Select **Apply**.

Attendees can see live translated captions in only one of the languages you preselected.

## Use live translated captions

By default, live captions are shown in the language used during the meeting or event. Live translated captions allow users to see captions translated into the language they’re most comfortable with.

**Note:**Live translated captions in meetings are only available as part of Teams Premium, an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to Teams Premium, contact your IT admin.

### To use live translated captions:

1. Turn on live captions in your meeting.
2. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
3. Make sure **Meeting spoken language** is correct.
4. Turn on the **Translate to** toggle.
5. In the dropdown menu, select the language you want your captions translated to.

### Customize captions

If you're using the desktop app on Windows or Mac, you can customize the font size and color, increase the number of lines displayed, and change the positioning of the captions in the meeting window.

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Caption styles** ![Color icon in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/8fdf1401-2b5e-4511-81a1-83c9e4e2f20f).
2. Choose the color, position, and style you want to see your captions in.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### Get the most out of your captions

To make sure your live captions are as accurate as possible, try these best practices:

* Speak clearly, slowly, and directly into the mic. As your distance from the mic increases, captions may become less accurate.
* Avoid locations with background noise.
* Avoid having multiple people speak at the same time.
* Use the highest-quality Teams-certified equipment available to you.

**Note:**Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### FAQ

#### Where does Teams process the data it uses to provide live captions?

We process the data in the geographical region where your organization is based.

#### What data does Teams use to create the captions?

The Microsoft Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology service, which generates Teams meeting captions, may use a meeting's subject, invitation, participant names, attachments, and recent emails of the participants to improve the accuracy of captions.

#### How does Teams translate live captions?

We use the Microsoft Speech Translation technology powered by Azure Cognitive Services for translating live captions.

#### Who has access to this data?

No one. Microsoft ASR involves no human intervention, and no one can access the meeting audio or any other meeting information at any time.

#### Does Teams store any caption data?

No. Caption data is permanently deleted after the meeting is over.

#### If I don't want Teams to process this data to begin with, can I prevent it?

Yes. Simply don't turn on live captions. Your admin can also disable the feature altogether. Go herefor more info about how to do that.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

Teams can detect what's said in a meeting or group call and present real-time captions.

**Note:**Captions aren't yet available in government clouds on the Teams mobile app.

## FAQ

### Why is my meeting recording automatically if I didn’t schedule it that way?

* If you schedule a meeting or event using the town hall or webinar template, automatic recording and transcription will be on by default.   
    
  To turn off automatic recording before the meeting or event starts, open the event details in your Teams calendar and select **Meeting options**  ![Settings icon](/images/en-us/e2a1f329-d95b-7d5e-181c-7c3e12fd9321) > **Recording & transcription** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

### What happens if the meeting organizer is a shared mailbox?

If you’re scheduling meetings on behalf of a shared mailbox, the shared mailbox will be the meeting organizer. To learn more, see Shared mailbox scheduled meetings.

### Where is my recording?

If you can’t find a recording:

* Check if there is a message indicating that your recording started. If you don’t see this message, the recording most likely didn’t start and can’t be recovered.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a recording start notification.](/images/en-us/dc21305a-252b-4f92-8b1a-e733b250e474)
* If you know the recording was started but can’t find it in OneDrive, check if it was deleted, moved to a different location, or expired. Look in your recycle bin and second stage recycle bin.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a file recycle bin highlighting where to find the second stage recycle bin.](/images/en-us/90900c77-8b4c-4c28-a09c-5538d6301610)
* If you can’t find your recording in OneDrive but see this recording chiclet in your chat history, your recording failed to upload to OneDrive and will be stored in a temporary storage for 21 days. You can retry uploading it to OneDrive or download it to your local device.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a recording chiclet that indicated the recording upload failed.](/images/en-us/e2fbb734-95a5-464a-9a35-a3afd9245f14)

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers can easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

See [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019) for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

To choose who can record and transcribe:

## New calendar

6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Desktop
Mobile
Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Select Video effects.

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed.

Select Add new  to upload and use an image from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

Select Preview to view the background before you apply it.

Select Apply.

Notes: 

Linux users aren't able to use this feature.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

If you enjoy custom backgrounds in Teams, you may also like customizing your desktop with a new image every day from the Bing Wallpaper app. This app automatically updates your desktop background with the Bing image of the day, showcasing stunning photographs from around the world. Each image comes with a brief description, allowing you to learn more about the location or subject featured in the photo. The Bing Wallpaper app is easy to install and use, providing a seamless way to keep your desktop visually engaging and informative.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Live c​​​​​​​aptions in Teams

Teams can detect what’s said in a meeting and present real-time captions. If you're using the desktop app for Windows or Mac, there are also several caption customization options.

**Notes:**

* People can choose not to be identified in captions. For details, see [Hide your identity in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).
* Teams doesn't save captions. If you'd like a transcript of the meeting, turn on transcription. You'll be able to download the transcript after the meeting.

There are a couple ways to get live captions in Teams:

* From the built-in captioning provided by Teams
* From a Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART) captioner. To learn how to use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting, refer to [Use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting (human generated captions)](/en-us/office/use-cart-captions-in-a-microsoft-teams-meeting-human-generated-captions-2dd889e8-32a8-4582-98b8-6c96cf14eb47).

## Live caption settings

Teams has built-in closed captioning you can turn on from the meeting controls.

### Turn captions on and off

* To use live captions in a meeting, go to your meeting controls at the top of the screen and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Show live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).
* To stop using live captions, go to your meeting controls and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Hide live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).

### Change the spoken language

Set a meeting’s spoken language to the language people are speaking for more accurate captions.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To access the meeting spoken language settings:

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
2. In the **Meeting spoken language** dropdown menu, select the language everyone is speaking from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Update** to change.

**Important:**For other participants to access the meeting spoken language, transcription must be turned off. If there’s an ongoing transcription, they must first turn it off or turn off the feature that started the transcription. Then, they must manually turn transcription on again.

## Set up live translated captions in an event

In town halls and live events, organizers preselect which languages attendees can see live captions in. Organizers can select six languages, or ten if they have Premium, from over 50 different languages.

### To set up live translated captions in an event:

1. Open the event in your Teams calendar.
2. In **Details**, select **Meeting options** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e).
3. In **Engagement**​​​​​​​  ![Teams Chat Tab icon](/images/en-us/3c2a24f3-7e8f-4419-8c78-16c5a795d45f) > **Translate attendee captions**, select the languages that live translated captions will be available in during your event.  
     
   ![Meeting option showing how to add languages for live translated captions in an event.](/images/en-us/7249ee23-9636-4844-b2a0-f0dae56359f7)
4. Select **Apply**.

Attendees can see live translated captions in only one of the languages you preselected.

## Use live translated captions

By default, live captions are shown in the language used during the meeting or event. Live translated captions allow users to see captions translated into the language they’re most comfortable with.

**Note:**Live translated captions in meetings are only available as part of Teams Premium, an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to Teams Premium, contact your IT admin.

### To use live translated captions:

1. Turn on live captions in your meeting.
2. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
3. Make sure **Meeting spoken language** is correct.
4. Turn on the **Translate to** toggle.
5. In the dropdown menu, select the language you want your captions translated to.

### Customize captions

If you're using the desktop app on Windows or Mac, you can customize the font size and color, increase the number of lines displayed, and change the positioning of the captions in the meeting window.

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Caption styles** ![Color icon in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/8fdf1401-2b5e-4511-81a1-83c9e4e2f20f).
2. Choose the color, position, and style you want to see your captions in.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

### Get the most out of your captions

To make sure your live captions are as accurate as possible, try these best practices:

* Speak clearly, slowly, and directly into the mic. As your distance from the mic increases, captions may become less accurate.
* Avoid locations with background noise.
* Avoid having multiple people speak at the same time.
* Use the highest-quality Teams-certified equipment available to you.

**Note:**Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### FAQ

#### Where does Teams process the data it uses to provide live captions?

We process the data in the geographical region where your organization is based.

#### What data does Teams use to create the captions?

The Microsoft Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology service, which generates Teams meeting captions, may use a meeting's subject, invitation, participant names, attachments, and recent emails of the participants to improve the accuracy of captions.

#### How does Teams translate live captions?

We use the Microsoft Speech Translation technology powered by Azure Cognitive Services for translating live captions.

#### Who has access to this data?

No one. Microsoft ASR involves no human intervention, and no one can access the meeting audio or any other meeting information at any time.

#### Does Teams store any caption data?

No. Caption data is permanently deleted after the meeting is over.

#### If I don't want Teams to process this data to begin with, can I prevent it?

Yes. Simply don't turn on live captions. Your admin can also disable the feature altogether. Go herefor more info about how to do that.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

Teams can detect what's said in a meeting or group call and present real-time captions.

**Note:**Captions aren't yet available in government clouds on the Teams mobile app.

## FAQ

### Why is my meeting recording automatically if I didn’t schedule it that way?

* If you schedule a meeting or event using the town hall or webinar template, automatic recording and transcription will be on by default.   
    
  To turn off automatic recording before the meeting or event starts, open the event details in your Teams calendar and select **Meeting options**  ![Settings icon](/images/en-us/e2a1f329-d95b-7d5e-181c-7c3e12fd9321) > **Recording & transcription** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e). Then, turn the **Record and transcribe automatically** toggle off.   
    
  To learn more, see [Manage webinar recordings](/en-us/office/manage-webinar-recordings-in-microsoft-teams-8cf1ba61-c9d8-4628-8b5d-0dcdb8503144) or [Manage town hall recordings](/en-us/office/manage-town-hall-recordings-in-microsoft-teams-88ac3af7-db67-4556-a202-b73a1d6c2e46).
* If you have a compliance recording policy, recording will start automatically every time you join a meeting. This recording will be stored in your org’s storage and not your personal OneDrive or Microsoft SharePoint.  
    
  To learn more, see Third-party compliance recording for Teams calls and meetings.

### Where are recordings and transcripts saved?

Please see Recording storage.

### What do the recording & transcript meeting options do?

When you organize a meeting in Teams, you can adjust recording and transcript settings and permissions in the meeting options. Learn more about recording and transcript options in the table below:

| Meeting option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Record and transcribe automatically** | When this option is turned on, recording and transcription will start automatically when the meeting begins.  This option will be turned off if **Who can record and transcribe** is set to **No one**. |
| **Who can record and transcribe** | This option controls who can start recording or transcription during a meeting.   * If **Organizers and co-organizers** is selected, participants won’t be able to start the recording or transcription. * If **No one** is selected, nobody in the meeting can start the recording or transcription.   Limitations:   * This option can’t be set to **No one** if **Allow Copilot** is set to **During and after the meeting**. * This option can only be set to **No one** if **Allow Copilot** is turned off. * This option isn’t available if **Record and transcribe automatically** is turned on. |
| **Enable multilingual speech recognition**   *\*Teams Premium* | This allows everyone to be understood in the spoken language they set at the beginning of the meeting. This will be turned on automatically if Interpreter is on. To learn more, see [Interpreter in Microsoft Teams meetings](/en-us/office/interpreter-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c7efe2bb-535d-42ab-a5c4-d2d91619b46d#bkmk_multilingual_recognition). |

### What happens if the meeting organizer is a shared mailbox?

If you’re scheduling meetings on behalf of a shared mailbox, the shared mailbox will be the meeting organizer. To learn more, see Shared mailbox scheduled meetings.

### Where is my recording?

If you can’t find a recording:

* Check if there is a message indicating that your recording started. If you don’t see this message, the recording most likely didn’t start and can’t be recovered.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a recording start notification.](/images/en-us/dc21305a-252b-4f92-8b1a-e733b250e474)
* If you know the recording was started but can’t find it in OneDrive, check if it was deleted, moved to a different location, or expired. Look in your recycle bin and second stage recycle bin.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a file recycle bin highlighting where to find the second stage recycle bin.](/images/en-us/90900c77-8b4c-4c28-a09c-5538d6301610)
* If you can’t find your recording in OneDrive but see this recording chiclet in your chat history, your recording failed to upload to OneDrive and will be stored in a temporary storage for 21 days. You can retry uploading it to OneDrive or download it to your local device.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a recording chiclet that indicated the recording upload failed.](/images/en-us/e2fbb734-95a5-464a-9a35-a3afd9245f14)
* If you see this chiclet in your chat history, the recording was permanently deleted from the temporary storage and can’t be recovered.  
    
  ​​​​​​​ ![Screenshot showing a recording chiclet that indicated the recording was permanently deleted.](/images/en-us/59d128e9-3af7-4185-ac58-a436f2ab2487)

## Live c​​​​​​​aptions in Teams

Teams can detect what’s said in a meeting and present real-time captions. If you're using the desktop app for Windows or Mac, there are also several caption customization options.

**Notes:**

* People can choose not to be identified in captions. For details, see [Hide your identity in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).
* Teams doesn't save captions. If you'd like a transcript of the meeting, turn on transcription. You'll be able to download the transcript after the meeting.

There are a couple ways to get live captions in Teams:

* From the built-in captioning provided by Teams
* From a Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART) captioner. To learn how to use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting, refer to [Use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting (human generated captions)](/en-us/office/use-cart-captions-in-a-microsoft-teams-meeting-human-generated-captions-2dd889e8-32a8-4582-98b8-6c96cf14eb47).

## Live caption settings

Teams has built-in closed captioning you can turn on from the meeting controls.

### Change the spoken language

Set a meeting’s spoken language to the language people are speaking for more accurate captions.

If people are speaking a different language than the meeting’s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To access the meeting spoken language settings:

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
2. In the **Meeting spoken language** dropdown menu, select the language everyone is speaking from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Update** to change.

**Important:**For other participants to access the meeting spoken language, transcription must be turned off. If there’s an ongoing transcription, they must first turn it off or turn off the feature that started the transcription. Then, they must manually turn transcription on again.

## Set up live translated captions in an event

4. Select **Apply**.

Attendees can see live translated captions in only one of the languages you preselected.

## Use live translated captions

By default, live captions are shown in the language used during the meeting or event. Live translated captions allow users to see captions translated into the language they’re most comfortable with.

**Note:**Live translated captions in meetings are only available as part of Teams Premium, an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to Teams Premium, contact your IT admin.

3. Make sure **Meeting spoken language** is correct.
4. Turn on the **Translate to** toggle.
5. In the dropdown menu, select the language you want your captions translated to.

### Customize captions

If you're using the desktop app on Windows or Mac, you can customize the font size and color, increase the number of lines displayed, and change the positioning of the captions in the meeting window.

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Caption styles** ![Color icon in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/8fdf1401-2b5e-4511-81a1-83c9e4e2f20f).

### Get the most out of your captions

To make sure your live captions are as accurate as possible, try these best practices:

* Speak clearly, slowly, and directly into the mic. As your distance from the mic increases, captions may become less accurate.
* Avoid locations with background noise.
* Avoid having multiple people speak at the same time.
* Use the highest-quality Teams-certified equipment available to you.

**Note:**Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### FAQ

#### Where does Teams process the data it uses to provide live captions?

We process the data in the geographical region where your organization is based.

#### What data does Teams use to create the captions?

The Microsoft Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology service, which generates Teams meeting captions, may use a meeting's subject, invitation, participant names, attachments, and recent emails of the participants to improve the accuracy of captions.

#### How does Teams translate live captions?

We use the Microsoft Speech Translation technology powered by Azure Cognitive Services for translating live captions.

#### Who has access to this data?

No one. Microsoft ASR involves no human intervention, and no one can access the meeting audio or any other meeting information at any time.

#### Does Teams store any caption data?

No. Caption data is permanently deleted after the meeting is over.

#### If I don't want Teams to process this data to begin with, can I prevent it?

Yes. Simply don't turn on live captions. Your admin can also disable the feature altogether. Go herefor more info about how to do that.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

Teams can detect what's said in a meeting or group call and present real-time captions.

**Note:**Captions aren't yet available in government clouds on the Teams mobile app.

Access to a Microsoft Teams meeting chat varies depending on an attendee’s relation to the org the meeting is organized in, the way they were invited to the meeting, the type of meeting, and lobby bypass settings.

To learn more about participating in Teams meeting chats, see [Chat in Microsoft Teams meetings](/en-us/office/chat-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-64e2cb91-8a11-4781-94ea-fbb23f2b922f).

## Types of meeting chat access

### Temporary access

If an attendee has temporary meeting chat access, they can access the meeting chat from the time they join the meeting until the meeting ends. People who join anonymously retain access until they leave the meeting.

### Permanent access

If an attendee has permanent meeting chat access, they can view, send, and receive messages in the meeting chat during and after the meeting until they leave the chat. They also might have access to meeting chat before the meeting starts, depending on how and when they were added.

**Important:**Only those with meeting chat access when a meeting recording is saved will have automatic access to the recording. To learn more about managing recording access, see [Play, share, and download a meeting recording in Microsoft Teams](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## Meeting chat capacity

Meeting chat capacity is the maximum number of attendees who can access chat before, during, and after a meeting. Meeting capacity fluctuates based on the type of meeting and when the chat occurs.

|  | Single-instance meeting | Meeting series (entire series or single instance) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Before meeting** | 750 people | 750 people |
| **During meeting** | 1,000 people | 1,000 people |
| **After meeting** | 1,000 people | 750 people |

* Chat capacity is reduced before single-instance meetings to provide more space for people who weren’t directly invited but engage in the meeting (e.g., were requested to join, joined via link, etc.). Up to 1,000 attendees will have permanent access to the meeting chat when the meeting ends.
* Up to 750 people invited to a meeting series will have permanent chat access at the time the series is scheduled. Up to 250 additional attendees who join the meeting will have chat access until the meeting ends. This provides buffer space in case additional people are invited to future occurrences.

### Chat access for contact lists

Inviting a contact list (or contact group) to your meeting invite is an easy way to bulk-invite a large group of people within your org. If the number of people in a contact list exceeds the meeting chat capacity, there are a few nuances to consider:

* In a meeting series, all members of contact lists that exceed 150 people will have temporary chat access while they’re in the meetings. They won’t have access to chat before or after the meetings.
* In single-instance meetings, members of contact lists that exceed 150 people will have permanent chat access after they join the meeting. They won’t have access to chat before joining.

To learn more about creating contact lists, see [Create, edit, or delete a contact list](/en-us/office/create-edit-or-delete-a-contact-list-or-contact-group-in-outlook-88ff6c60-0a1d-4b54-8c9d-9e1a71bc3023).

## Access meeting chat and chat history

The relation someone has to your org significantly impacts their access to your Teams meeting chat. Their access varies depending on whether they’re:

* In your org
* In a trusted org
* Joining from a trusted Teams (free) account
* Joining anonymously

Learn more about how meeting chat access varies based on relation to your org below.

### People joining anonymously

To protect information shared in ongoing chats, people joining a meeting anonymously will always have temporary access to a meeting chat, regardless of how they’re invited or the type of meeting they’re joining.

Guests and people joining anonymously will have access to the meeting chat from the time they join the meeting until they leave. They won’t have access to chat history.

To learn more about working with external guests, see [Work with external guests](/en-us/office/work-with-external-guests-180ed260-d3ef-4247-9f24-1984fc76d5f0).

## Channel meeting chat

Channel meeting chats are only available to channel members. To make sure someone has access to a channel meeting chat, add them to that channel.

To learn more, see [Create a standard, private, or shared channel in Microsoft Teams](/en-us/office/create-a-standard-private-or-shared-channel-in-microsoft-teams-fda0b75e-5b90-4fb8-8857-7e102b014525).

## Access to meeting chat history

People in your org can access meeting chat history if they were directly added to the meeting or meeting series invite. If they were nudged in, forwarded the meeting invite, or joined via link, they can’t access chats from before they joined or were added. If they’re added directly to a meeting chat, the person adding them to the chat will decide how much chat history they can access.

People outside your org won’t be able to access chat history or be added to a meeting chat directly.

## Add someone to a meeting chat

Add people in your org directly to a meeting chat to make sure they have permanent access.

To add someone to a meeting chat:

1. Select **Chat** ![Teams Chat Tab icon](/images/en-us/3c2a24f3-7e8f-4419-8c78-16c5a795d45f) in Teams.
2. Select the meeting chat you want to add them to.

   * Meeting chats are distinguished by the calendar icon: ![Teams Calendar tab icon](/images/en-us/2975b9cc-8d8c-4cec-8585-63cadfca9b49).
3. Select **View and add participants** ![Add people icon](/images/en-us/db146a01-d257-4d05-b926-cc1ab719b6ea) > **Add people** ![Add people icon](/images/en-us/db146a01-d257-4d05-b926-cc1ab719b6ea).
4. Enter the name, email, or tag you want to add.
5. Select how much chat history you want to share with them.
6. Select **Add**.

People outside your org can’t be added to an existing meeting chat. If you try to add someone outside of your org to a meeting chat, you’ll be prompted to create a new group chat. The new group chat will include everyone in the existing meeting chat and the person you’re adding.

## FAQ

### I was removed from the meeting chat after the meeting was over. How do I get permanent access?

For permanent meeting chat access, ask another meeting participant to forward you the entire meeting series or add you directly to the meeting chat.

### I invited a contact list to a meeting and not everyone has access to meeting chat. They also can’t access the recording. How does their chat access work?

People in contact lists exceeding 150 people only have access to the meeting chat during the meeting. They won’t have access before or after. People who don’t have chat access at the time a meeting recording is saved (when someone stops the recording or the meeting ends) can’t access the recording.

To ensure chat access for specific people in the contact list, add them directly when you schedule the meeting. To give someone access to a recording, you can share the recording with them directly. To learn more, see [Chat access for contact lists](#bkmk_chat_capacity) and [Share a meeting recording](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

### I invited someone outside my org to a meeting; how do I make sure they have chat access?

When you invite someone from a trusted org to your meeting, consider changing your lobby bypass settings to allow them to bypass the lobby if you want them to have chat access before the meeting starts.

People joining a meeting anonymously or from other accounts outside your org won’t have access to the meeting chat outside of the meeting.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Desktop
Mobile
Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Select Video effects.

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed.

Select Add new  to upload and use an image from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

Select Preview to view the background before you apply it.

Select Apply.

Notes: 

Linux users aren't able to use this feature.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

Each image comes with a brief description, allowing you to learn more about the location or subject featured in the photo. The Bing Wallpaper app is easy to install and use, providing a seamless way to keep your desktop visually engaging and informative.

To start a live transcription only:

1. Select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c) in your meeting controls.

​​​​​​​All participants see a notification that the meeting is being transcribed. Participants can choose to [hide their identities in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).

Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### Change transcription language

To ensure transcription accuracy, make sure the meeting spoken language reflects the language everyone is speaking.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To change the transcription language:

1. Select **More actions**  ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c) in your meeting controls.
2. Hover over **Record and transcribe**  ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

5. In **Meeting spoken language**, select the language people are speaking.
6. Select **Update**. The transcript will now display in this language.

**Important:**For other participants to access the meeting spoken language, transcription must be turned off. If there’s an ongoing transcription, they must first turn it off or turn off the feature that started the transcription. Then, they must manually turn transcription on again.

For info about organizer and presenter roles, see [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

**Notes:**

* Teams live transcripts for meetings with recording and/or transcription are stored in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business. The transcript can be accessed through the meeting chat and **Recap** tab in Teams until a meeting organizer deletes the transcript.
* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

During a Teams meeting, you can start a live transcription that captures everything being said. The text appears alongside the meeting video or audio in real time, including the speaker's name and time stamp.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

See [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019) for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

**Notes:**

* To use this feature, the event must be at least transcribed. For the best recap experience, record and transcribe the event.
* AI summaries might look different based on the event's transcription language. This is due to differences in AI language models. We're continuing to improve these features.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

There are three options for who can record and transcribe a meeting:

* Organizers and co-organizers
* Organizers, co-organizers and presenters
* No one

For info about organizer and presenter roles, see [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

People who call into a meeting can't view the transcript.

**Notes:**

* Teams live transcripts for meetings with recording and/or transcription are stored in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business. The transcript can be accessed through the meeting chat and **Recap** tab in Teams until a meeting organizer deletes the transcript.
* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

During a Teams meeting, you can start a live transcription that captures everything being said. The text appears alongside the meeting video or audio in real time, including the speaker's name and time stamp.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers can easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

See [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019) for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note: Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Desktop
Mobile
Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​ 

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note: If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Select Video effects.

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

​​​​​​​Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed.

Select Add new  to upload and use an image from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

Select Preview to view the background before you apply it.

Select Apply.

Notes: 

Linux users aren't able to use this feature.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

Each image comes with a brief description, allowing you to learn more about the location or subject featured in the photo. The Bing Wallpaper app is easy to install and use, providing a seamless way to keep your desktop visually engaging and informative.

For info about organizer and presenter roles, see [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

**Notes:**

* Teams live transcripts for meetings with recording and/or transcription are stored in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business. The transcript can be accessed through the meeting chat and **Recap** tab in Teams until a meeting organizer deletes the transcript.
* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meeting’s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone in the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meeting’s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can record and transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcripts is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies to recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option setting will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizer’s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participant’s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms: Desktop (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn on [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, select **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)> **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stop the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stop the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places depending on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat or channel conversation (if you’re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.​​​​​​​

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recording leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

5. In **Recording and transcription** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)​​​​​​​, choose your preference in the **Who can record and transcribe** dropdown menu.
6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expiration of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **edit permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message, hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip, click the "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)​​​​​​​
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video. Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worry—if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizers can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.​​​​​​​

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording** in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, select **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**​​​​​​​ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll be [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chat—or in the channel, if you’re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved to Stream. Then, it's ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording will appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it before recording.

DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or shorten ANY part of the quoted answer, unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize giving the most detailed answer possible by quoting the all relevant text from the content. If the content has numbers, prices, code, tables, or other specific details, quote them exactly as they appear. If multiple relevant passages are found, include ALL of them in their entirety, word-for-word. ALWAYS provide which page they should visit to find the exact information they are looking for, if possible, by saying 'Please visit [page URL] for the full details.' If you cite information from a source, always include the full URL shown in the source.If no answer is found, summarize anything related, and politely inform the user that the answer does not appear to be present, suggest a related page by URL if present in the content. Do not hallucinate.At the end, write 'SUFFICIENT: YES' if the answer fully resolves the question, or 'SUFFICIENT: NO' if not. Write 'CONFIDENCE: <0-100>%'

# Progressive Web Crawling with Adaptive Information Foraging

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel approach to web crawling that adaptively determines when sufficient information has been gathered to answer a given query. Unlike traditional exhaustive crawling methods, our Progressive Information Sufficiency (PIS) framework uses statistical measures to balance information completeness against crawling efficiency. We introduce a multi-strategy architecture supporting pure statistical, embedding-enhanced, and LLM-assisted approaches, with theoretical guarantees on convergence and practical evaluation methods using synthetic datasets.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional web crawling approaches follow predetermined patterns (breadth-first, depth-first) without consideration for information sufficiency. This work addresses the fundamental question: *"When do we have enough information to answer a query and similar queries in its domain?"*

We formalize this as an optimal stopping problem in information foraging, introducing metrics for coverage, consistency, and saturation that enable crawlers to make intelligent decisions about when to stop crawling and which links to follow.

## 2. Problem Formulation

### 2.1 Definitions

Let:

* **K** = {d₁, d₂, ..., dₙ} be the current knowledge base (crawled documents)
* **Q** be the user query
* **L** = {l₁, l₂, ..., lₘ} be available links with preview metadata
* **θ** be the confidence threshold for information sufficiency

### 2.2 Objectives

1. **Minimize** |K| (number of crawled pages)
2. **Maximize** P(answers(Q) | K) (probability of answering Q given K)
3. **Ensure** coverage of Q's domain (similar queries)

## 3. Mathematical Framework

### 3.1 Information Sufficiency Metric

We define Information Sufficiency as:

```
IS(K, Q) = min(Coverage(K, Q), Consistency(K, Q), 1 - Redundancy(K)) × DomainCoverage(K, Q)

```

### 3.2 Coverage Score

Coverage measures how well current knowledge covers query terms and related concepts:

```
Coverage(K, Q) = Σ(t ∈ Q) log(df(t, K) + 1) × idf(t) / |Q|

```

Where:

* df(t, K) = document frequency of term t in knowledge base K
* idf(t) = inverse document frequency weight

### 3.3 Consistency Score

Consistency measures information coherence across documents:

```
Consistency(K, Q) = 1 - Var(answers from random subsets of K)

```

This captures the principle that sufficient knowledge should provide stable answers regardless of document subset.

### 3.4 Saturation Score

Saturation detects diminishing returns:

```
Saturation(K) = 1 - (ΔInfo(Kₙ) / ΔInfo(K₁))

```

Where ΔInfo represents marginal information gain from the nth crawl.

### 3.5 Link Value Prediction

Expected information gain from uncrawled links:

```
ExpectedGain(l) = Relevance(l, Q) × Novelty(l, K) × Authority(l)

```

Components:

* **Relevance**: BM25(preview\_text, Q)
* **Novelty**: 1 - max\_similarity(preview, K)
* **Authority**: f(url\_structure, domain\_metrics)

## 4. Algorithmic Approach

### 4.1 Progressive Crawling Algorithm

```
Algorithm: ProgressiveCrawl(start_url, query, θ)
  K ← ∅
  crawled ← {start_url}
  pending ← extract_links(crawl(start_url))
  
  while IS(K, Q) < θ and |crawled| < max_pages:
    candidates ← rank_by_expected_gain(pending, Q, K)
    if max(ExpectedGain(candidates)) < min_gain:
      break  // Diminishing returns
    
    to_crawl ← top_k(candidates)
    new_docs ← parallel_crawl(to_crawl)
    K ← K ∪ new_docs
    crawled ← crawled ∪ to_crawl
    pending ← extract_new_links(new_docs) - crawled
  
  return K

```

### 4.2 Stopping Criteria

Crawling terminates when:

1. IS(K, Q) ≥ θ (sufficient information)
2. d(IS)/d(crawls) < ε (plateau reached)
3. |crawled| ≥ max\_pages (resource limit)
4. max(ExpectedGain) < min\_gain (no promising links)

## 5. Multi-Strategy Architecture

### 5.1 Strategy Pattern Design

```
AbstractStrategy
  ├── StatisticalStrategy (no LLM, no embeddings)
  ├── EmbeddingStrategy (with semantic similarity)
  └── LLMStrategy (with language model assistance)

```

### 5.2 Statistical Strategy

Pure statistical approach using:

* BM25 for relevance scoring
* Term frequency analysis for coverage
* Graph structure for authority
* No external models required

**Advantages**: Fast, no API costs, works offline
**Best for**: Technical documentation, specific terminology

### 5.3 Embedding Strategy (Implemented)

Semantic understanding through embeddings:

* Query expansion into semantic variations
* Coverage mapping in embedding space
* Gap-driven link selection
* Validation-based stopping criteria

**Mathematical Framework**:

```
Coverage(K, Q) = mean(max_similarity(q, K) for q in Q_expanded)
Gap(q) = 1 - max_similarity(q, K)
LinkScore(l) = Σ(Gap(q) × relevance(l, q)) × (1 - redundancy(l, K))

```

**Key Parameters**:

* `embedding_k_exp`: Exponential decay factor for distance-to-score mapping
* `embedding_coverage_radius`: Distance threshold for query coverage
* `embedding_min_confidence_threshold`: Minimum relevance threshold

**Advantages**: Semantic understanding, handles ambiguity, detects irrelevance
**Best for**: Research queries, conceptual topics, diverse content

### 5.4 Progressive Enhancement Path

1. **Level 0**: Statistical only (implemented)
2. **Level 1**: + Embeddings for semantic similarity (implemented)
3. **Level 2**: + LLM for query understanding (future)

## 6. Evaluation Methodology

### 6.1 Synthetic Dataset Generation

Using LLM to create evaluation data:

```
def generate_synthetic_dataset(domain_url):
    # 1. Fully crawl domain
    full_knowledge = exhaustive_crawl(domain_url)
    
    # 2. Generate answerable queries
    queries = llm_generate_queries(full_knowledge)
    
    # 3. Create query variations
    for q in queries:
        variations = generate_variations(q)  # synonyms, sub/super queries
    
    return queries, variations, full_knowledge
```

### 6.2 Evaluation Metrics

1. **Efficiency**: Information gained / Pages crawled
2. **Completeness**: Answerable queries / Total queries
3. **Redundancy**: 1 - (Unique information / Total information)
4. **Convergence Rate**: Pages to 95% completeness

### 6.3 Ablation Studies

* Impact of each score component (coverage, consistency, saturation)
* Sensitivity to threshold parameters
* Performance across different domain types

## 7. Theoretical Properties

### 7.1 Convergence Guarantee

**Theorem**: For finite websites, ProgressiveCrawl converges to IS(K, Q) ≥ θ or exhausts all reachable pages.

**Proof sketch**: IS(K, Q) is monotonically non-decreasing with each crawl, bounded above by 1.

### 7.2 Optimality

Under certain assumptions about link preview accuracy:

* Expected crawls ≤ 2 × optimal\_crawls
* Approximation ratio improves with preview quality

## 8. Implementation Design

### 8.1 Core Components

1. **CrawlState**: Maintains crawl history and metrics
2. **AdaptiveConfig**: Configuration parameters
3. **CrawlStrategy**: Pluggable strategy interface
4. **AdaptiveCrawler**: Main orchestrator

### 8.2 Integration with Crawl4AI

* Wraps existing AsyncWebCrawler
* Leverages link preview functionality
* Maintains backward compatibility

### 8.3 Persistence

Knowledge base serialization for:

* Resumable crawls
* Knowledge sharing
* Offline analysis

## 9. Future Directions

### 9.1 Advanced Scoring

* Temporal information value
* Multi-query optimization
* Active learning from user feedback

### 9.2 Distributed Crawling

* Collaborative knowledge building
* Federated information sufficiency

### 9.3 Domain Adaptation

* Transfer learning across domains
* Meta-learning for threshold selection

## 10. Conclusion

Progressive crawling with adaptive information foraging provides a principled approach to efficient web information extraction. By combining coverage, consistency, and saturation metrics, we can determine information sufficiency without ground truth labels. The multi-strategy architecture allows graceful enhancement from pure statistical to LLM-assisted approaches based on requirements and resources.

🤓 **My Personal Story**

My journey with computers started in childhood when my dad, a computer scientist, introduced me to an Amstrad computer. Those early days sparked a fascination with technology, leading me to pursue computer science and specialize in NLP during my postgraduate studies. It was during this time that I first delved into web crawling, building tools to help researchers organize papers and extract information from publications a challenging yet rewarding experience that honed my skills in data extraction.

Fast forward to 2023, I was working on a tool for a project and needed a crawler to convert a webpage into markdown. While exploring solutions, I found one that claimed to be open-source but required creating an account and generating an API token. Worse, it turned out to be a SaaS model charging $16, and its quality didn’t meet my standards. Frustrated, I realized this was a deeper problem. That frustration turned into turbo anger mode, and I decided to build my own solution. In just a few days, I created Crawl4AI. To my surprise, it went viral, earning thousands of GitHub stars and resonating with a global community.

I made Crawl4AI open-source for two reasons. First, it’s my way of giving back to the open-source community that has supported me throughout my career. Second, I believe data should be accessible to everyone, not locked behind paywalls or monopolized by a few. Open access to data lays the foundation for the democratization of AI, a vision where individuals can train their own models and take ownership of their information. This library is the first step in a larger journey to create the best open-source data extraction and generation tool the world has ever seen, built collaboratively by a passionate community.

Thank you to everyone who has supported this project, used it, and shared feedback. Your encouragement motivates me to dream even bigger. Join us, file issues, submit PRs, or spread the word. Together, we can build a tool that truly empowers people to access their own data and reshape the future of AI.

## Installation 🛠️

Crawl4AI offers flexible installation options to suit various use cases. You can install it as a Python package or use Docker.

🐍 **Using pip**

Choose the installation option that best fits your needs:

### Basic Installation

For basic web crawling and scraping tasks:

```
pip install crawl4ai
crawl4ai-setup # Setup the browser
```

By default, this will install the asynchronous version of Crawl4AI, using Playwright for web crawling.

👉 **Note**: When you install Crawl4AI, the `crawl4ai-setup` should automatically install and set up Playwright. However, if you encounter any Playwright-related errors, you can manually install it using one of these methods:

1. Through the command line:

   ```
   playwright install
   ```
2. If the above doesn't work, try this more specific command:

   ```
   python -m playwright install chromium
   ```

This second method has proven to be more reliable in some cases.

### Installation with Synchronous Version

The sync version is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. If you need the synchronous version using Selenium:

```
pip install crawl4ai[sync]
```

---

### Development Installation

For contributors who plan to modify the source code:

```
git clone 
cd crawl4ai
pip install -e .                    # Basic installation in editable mode

      strategy="statistical"
  )

  async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
      adaptive_crawler = AdaptiveCrawler(crawler, config)
      state = await adaptive_crawler.digest(

## Version Numbering in Crawl4AI

Crawl4AI follows standard Python version numbering conventions (PEP 440) to help users understand the stability and features of each release.

### Version Numbers Explained

Our version numbers follow this pattern: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., 0.4.3)

#### Pre-release Versions

We use different suffixes to indicate development stages:

* `dev` (0.4.3dev1): Development versions, unstable
* `a` (0.4.3a1): Alpha releases, experimental features
* `b` (0.4.3b1): Beta releases, feature complete but needs testing
* `rc` (0.4.3): Release candidates, potential final version

#### Installation

* Regular installation (stable version):

  ```
  pip install -U crawl4ai
  ```
* Install pre-release versions:

  ```
  pip install crawl4ai --pre
  ```
* Install specific version:

  ```
  pip install crawl4ai==0.4.3b1
  ```

#### Why Pre-releases?

We use pre-releases to:

* Test new features in real-world scenarios
* Gather feedback before final releases
* Ensure stability for production users
* Allow early adopters to try new features

For production environments, we recommend using the stable version. For testing new features, you can opt-in to pre-releases using the `--pre` flag.
