# Add tools

To handle queries that your chatbot can't answer "from memory", integrate a web search tool. The chatbot can use this tool to find relevant information and provide better responses.

Note

This tutorial builds on Build a basic chatbot.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

* An API key for the Tavily Search Engine.

## 1. Install the search engine

Install the requirements to use the Tavily Search Engine:

```
pip install -U langchain-tavily

```

## 2. Configure your environment

Configure your environment with your search engine API key:

```
import os

os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = "tvly-..."

```

## 3. Define the tool

Define the web search tool:

*API Reference: TavilySearch*

```
from langchain_tavily import TavilySearch

tool = TavilySearch(max_results=2)
tools = [tool]
tool.invoke("What's a 'node' in LangGraph?")

```

The results are page summaries our chat bot can use to answer questions:

```
{'query': "What's a 'node' in LangGraph?",
'follow_up_questions': None,
'answer': None,
'images': [],
'results': [{'title': "Introduction to LangGraph: A Beginner's Guide - Medium",

'response_time': 1.38}

```

## 4. Define the graph

For the `StateGraph` you created in the first tutorial, add `bind_tools` on the LLM. This lets the LLM know the correct JSON format to use if it wants to use the search engine.

Let's first select our LLM:

[OpenAI](#__tabbed_1_1)[Anthropic](#__tabbed_1_2)[Azure](#__tabbed_1_3)[Google Gemini](#__tabbed_1_4)[AWS Bedrock](#__tabbed_1_5)

```
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

llm = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4.1")

```

ðŸ‘‰ Read the OpenAI integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[anthropic]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

llm = init_chat_model("anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

```

ðŸ‘‰ Read the Anthropic integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = "..."
os.environ["OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2025-03-01-preview"

llm = init_chat_model(
    "azure_openai:gpt-4.1",
    azure_deployment=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],
)

```

ðŸ‘‰ Read the Azure integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[google-genai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "..."

llm = init_chat_model("google_genai:gemini-2.0-flash")

```

ðŸ‘‰ Read the Google GenAI integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[aws]"

```

```
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

# Follow the steps here to configure your credentials:
# 

llm = init_chat_model(
    "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0",
    model_provider="bedrock_converse",
)

```

ðŸ‘‰ Read the AWS Bedrock integration docs

We can now incorporate it into a `StateGraph`:

*API Reference: StateGraph | START | END | add\_messages*

```
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Modification: tell the LLM which tools it can call
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

```

## 5. Create a function to run the tools

Now, create a function to run the tools if they are called. Do this by adding the tools to a new node called `BasicToolNode` that checks the most recent message in the state and calls tools if the message contains `tool_calls`. It relies on the LLM's `tool_calling` support, which is available in Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and a number of other LLM providers.

*API Reference: ToolMessage*

```
import json

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage

class BasicToolNode:
    """A node that runs the tools requested in the last AIMessage."""

    def __init__(self, tools: list) -> None:
        self.tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

    def __call__(self, inputs: dict):
        if messages := inputs.get("messages", []):
            message = messages[-1]
        else:
            raise ValueError("No message found in input")
        outputs = []
        for tool_call in message.tool_calls:
            tool_result = self.tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(
                tool_call["args"]
            )
            outputs.append(
                ToolMessage(
                    content=json.dumps(tool_result),
                    name=tool_call["name"],
                    tool_call_id=tool_call["id"],
                )
            )
        return {"messages": outputs}

tool_node = BasicToolNode(tools=[tool])
graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

```

Note

If you do not want to build this yourself in the future, you can use LangGraph's prebuilt ToolNode.

## 6. Define the `conditional_edges`

With the tool node added, now you can define the `conditional_edges`.

**Edges** route the control flow from one node to the next. **Conditional edges** start from a single node and usually contain "if" statements to route to different nodes depending on the current graph state. These functions receive the current graph `state` and return a string or list of strings indicating which node(s) to call next.

Next, define a router function called `route_tools` that checks for `tool_calls` in the chatbot's output. Provide this function to the graph by calling `add_conditional_edges`, which tells the graph that whenever the `chatbot` node completes to check this function to see where to go next.

The condition will route to `tools` if tool calls are present and `END` if not. Because the condition can return `END`, you do not need to explicitly set a `finish_point` this time.

```
def route_tools(
    state: State,
):
    """
    Use in the conditional_edge to route to the ToolNode if the last message
    has tool calls. Otherwise, route to the end.
    """
    if isinstance(state, list):
        ai_message = state[-1]
    elif messages := state.get("messages", []):
        ai_message = messages[-1]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"No messages found in input state to tool_edge: {state}")
    if hasattr(ai_message, "tool_calls") and len(ai_message.tool_calls) > 0:
        return "tools"
    return END

# The `tools_condition` function returns "tools" if the chatbot asks to use a tool, and "END" if
# it is fine directly responding. This conditional routing defines the main agent loop.
graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "chatbot",
    route_tools,
    # The following dictionary lets you tell the graph to interpret the condition's outputs as a specific node
    # It defaults to the identity function, but if you
    # want to use a node named something else apart from "tools",
    # You can update the value of the dictionary to something else
    # e.g., "tools": "my_tools"
    {"tools": "tools", END: END},
)
# Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph = graph_builder.compile()

```

Note

You can replace this with the prebuilt tools\_condition to be more concise.

## 7. Visualize the graph (optional)

You can visualize the graph using the `get_graph` method and one of the "draw" methods, like `draw_ascii` or `draw_png`. The `draw` methods each require additional dependencies.

```
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

```

!chatbot-with-tools-diagram

## 8. Ask the bot questions

Now you can ask the chatbot questions outside its training data:

```
def stream_graph_updates(user_input: str):
    for event in graph.stream({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]}):
        for value in event.values():
            print("Assistant:", value["messages"][-1].content)

while True:
    try:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit", "q"]:
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
    except:
        # fallback if input() is not available
        user_input = "What do you know about LangGraph?"
        print("User: " + user_input)
        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
        break

```

```

**Congratulations!** You've created a conversational agent in LangGraph that can use a search engine to retrieve updated information when needed. Now it can handle a wider range of user queries.

To inspect all the steps your agent just took, check out this LangSmith trace.

## Next steps

The chatbot cannot remember past interactions on its own, which limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the next part, you will add **memory** to address this.

CONTENT:
# LangGraph quickstart

This guide shows you how to set up and use LangGraph's **prebuilt**, **reusable** components, which are designed to help you construct agentic systems quickly and reliably.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

* An Anthropic API key

## 1. Install dependencies

If you haven't already, install LangGraph and LangChain:

```
pip install -U langgraph "langchain[anthropic]"

```

Info

`langchain[anthropic]` is installed so the agent can call the model.

## 2. Create an agent

To create an agent, use `create_react_agent`:

*API Reference: create\_react\_agent*

```
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:  
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",  
    tools=[get_weather],  
    prompt="You are a helpful assistant"  
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)

```

## 3. Configure an LLM

To configure an LLM with specific parameters, such as temperature, use init\_chat\_model:

*API Reference: init\_chat\_model | create\_react\_agent*

```
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

model = init_chat_model(
    "anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    temperature=0
)

agent = create_react_agent(
    model=model,
    tools=[get_weather],
)

```

For more information on how to configure LLMs, see Models.

## 4. Add a custom prompt

Prompts instruct the LLM how to behave. Add one of the following types of prompts:

* **Static**: A string is interpreted as a **system message**.
* **Dynamic**: A list of messages generated at **runtime**, based on input or configuration.

[Static prompt](#__tabbed_1_1)[Dynamic prompt](#__tabbed_1_2)

Define a fixed prompt string or list of messages:

```
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    # A static prompt that never changes
    prompt="Never answer questions about the weather."
)

agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)

```

Define a function that returns a message list based on the agent's state and configuration:

```
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor import AgentState
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def prompt(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig) -> list[AnyMessage]:  
    user_name = config["configurable"].get("user_name")
    system_msg = f"You are a helpful assistant. Address the user as {user_name}."
    return [{"role": "system", "content": system_msg}] + state["messages"]

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    prompt=prompt
)

agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]},
    config={"configurable": {"user_name": "John Smith"}}
)

```

1. Dynamic prompts allow including non-message context when constructing an input to the LLM, such as:

   * Information passed at runtime, like a `user_id` or API credentials (using `config`).
   * Internal agent state updated during a multi-step reasoning process (using `state`).

   Dynamic prompts can be defined as functions that take `state` and `config` and return a list of messages to send to the LLM.

For more information, see Context.

## 5. Add memory

To allow multi-turn conversations with an agent, you need to enable persistence by providing a checkpointer when creating an agent. At runtime, you need to provide a config containing `thread_id` â€” a unique identifier for the conversation (session):

*API Reference: create\_react\_agent | InMemorySaver*

```
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    checkpointer=checkpointer  
)

# Run the agent
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
sf_response = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]},
    config  
)
ny_response = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what about new york?"}]},
    config
)

```

When you enable the checkpointer, it stores agent state at every step in the provided checkpointer database (or in memory, if using `InMemorySaver`).

Note that in the above example, when the agent is invoked the second time with the same `thread_id`, the original message history from the first conversation is automatically included, together with the new user input.

For more information, see Memory.

## 6. Configure structured output

To produce structured responses conforming to a schema, use the `response_format` parameter. The schema can be defined with a `Pydantic` model or `TypedDict`. The result will be accessible via the `structured_response` field.

*API Reference: create\_react\_agent*

```
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

class WeatherResponse(BaseModel):
    conditions: str

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    response_format=WeatherResponse  
)

response = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)

response["structured_response"]

```

LLM post-processing

Structured output requires an additional call to the LLM to format the response according to the schema.

# Add tools

To handle queries that your chatbot can't answer "from memory", integrate a web search tool. The chatbot can use this tool to find relevant information and provide better responses.

Note

This tutorial builds on Build a basic chatbot.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

* An API key for the Tavily Search Engine.

## 1. Install the search engine

Install the requirements to use the Tavily Search Engine:

```
pip install -U langchain-tavily

```

## 2. Configure your environment

Configure your environment with your search engine API key:

```
import os

os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = "tvly-..."

```

## 3. Define the tool

Define the web search tool:

*API Reference: TavilySearch*

```
from langchain_tavily import TavilySearch

tool = TavilySearch(max_results=2)
tools = [tool]
tool.invoke("What's a 'node' in LangGraph?")

```

The results are page summaries our chat bot can use to answer questions:

```
{'query': "What's a 'node' in LangGraph?",
'follow_up_questions': None,
'answer': None,
'images': [],
'results': [{'title': "Introduction to LangGraph: A Beginner's Guide - Medium",

'response_time': 1.38}

```

## 4. Define the graph

For the `StateGraph` you created in the first tutorial, add `bind_tools` on the LLM. This lets the LLM know the correct JSON format to use if it wants to use the search engine.

Let's first select our LLM:

[OpenAI](#__tabbed_1_1)[Anthropic](#__tabbed_1_2)[Azure](#__tabbed_1_3)[Google Gemini](#__tabbed_1_4)[AWS Bedrock](#__tabbed_1_5)

```
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

llm = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4.1")

```

ðŸ‘‰ Read the OpenAI integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[anthropic]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

llm = init_chat_model("anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

```

ðŸ‘‰ Read the Anthropic integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = "..."
os.environ["OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2025-03-01-preview"

llm = init_chat_model(
    "azure_openai:gpt-4.1",
    azure_deployment=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],
)

```

ðŸ‘‰ Read the Azure integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[google-genai]"

```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "..."

llm = init_chat_model("google_genai:gemini-2.0-flash")

```

ðŸ‘‰ Read the Google GenAI integration docs

```
pip install -U "langchain[aws]"

```

```
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

# Follow the steps here to configure your credentials:
# 

llm = init_chat_model(
    "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0",
    model_provider="bedrock_converse",
)

```

ðŸ‘‰ Read the AWS Bedrock integration docs

We can now incorporate it into a `StateGraph`:

*API Reference: StateGraph | START | END | add\_messages*

```
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Modification: tell the LLM which tools it can call
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

```

## 5. Create a function to run the tools

Now, create a function to run the tools if they are called. Do this by adding the tools to a new node called `BasicToolNode` that checks the most recent message in the state and calls tools if the message contains `tool_calls`. It relies on the LLM's `tool_calling` support, which is available in Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and a number of other LLM providers.

*API Reference: ToolMessage*

```
import json

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage

class BasicToolNode:
    """A node that runs the tools requested in the last AIMessage."""

    def __init__(self, tools: list) -> None:
        self.tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

    def __call__(self, inputs: dict):
        if messages := inputs.get("messages", []):
            message = messages[-1]
        else:
            raise ValueError("No message found in input")
        outputs = []
        for tool_call in message.tool_calls:
            tool_result = self.tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(
                tool_call["args"]
            )
            outputs.append(
                ToolMessage(
                    content=json.dumps(tool_result),
                    name=tool_call["name"],
                    tool_call_id=tool_call["id"],
                )
            )
        return {"messages": outputs}

tool_node = BasicToolNode(tools=[tool])
graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

```

Note

If you do not want to build this yourself in the future, you can use LangGraph's prebuilt ToolNode.

## 6. Define the `conditional_edges`

With the tool node added, now you can define the `conditional_edges`.

**Edges** route the control flow from one node to the next. **Conditional edges** start from a single node and usually contain "if" statements to route to different nodes depending on the current graph state. These functions receive the current graph `state` and return a string or list of strings indicating which node(s) to call next.

Next, define a router function called `route_tools` that checks for `tool_calls` in the chatbot's output. Provide this function to the graph by calling `add_conditional_edges`, which tells the graph that whenever the `chatbot` node completes to check this function to see where to go next.

The condition will route to `tools` if tool calls are present and `END` if not. Because the condition can return `END`, you do not need to explicitly set a `finish_point` this time.

```
def route_tools(
    state: State,
):
    """
    Use in the conditional_edge to route to the ToolNode if the last message
    has tool calls. Otherwise, route to the end.
    """
    if isinstance(state, list):
        ai_message = state[-1]
    elif messages := state.get("messages", []):
        ai_message = messages[-1]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"No messages found in input state to tool_edge: {state}")
    if hasattr(ai_message, "tool_calls") and len(ai_message.tool_calls) > 0:
        return "tools"
    return END

# The `tools_condition` function returns "tools" if the chatbot asks to use a tool, and "END" if
# it is fine directly responding. This conditional routing defines the main agent loop.
graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "chatbot",
    route_tools,
    # The following dictionary lets you tell the graph to interpret the condition's outputs as a specific node
    # It defaults to the identity function, but if you
    # want to use a node named something else apart from "tools",
    # You can update the value of the dictionary to something else
    # e.g., "tools": "my_tools"
    {"tools": "tools", END: END},
)
# Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph = graph_builder.compile()

```

Note

You can replace this with the prebuilt tools\_condition to be more concise.

## 7. Visualize the graph (optional)

You can visualize the graph using the `get_graph` method and one of the "draw" methods, like `draw_ascii` or `draw_png`. The `draw` methods each require additional dependencies.

```
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

```

!chatbot-with-tools-diagram

## 8. Ask the bot questions

Now you can ask the chatbot questions outside its training data:

```
def stream_graph_updates(user_input: str):
    for event in graph.stream({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]}):
        for value in event.values():
            print("Assistant:", value["messages"][-1].content)

while True:
    try:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit", "q"]:
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
    except:
        # fallback if input() is not available
        user_input = "What do you know about LangGraph?"
        print("User: " + user_input)
        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
        break

```

```

graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph = graph_builder.compile()

```

**Congratulations!** You've created a conversational agent in LangGraph that can use a search engine to retrieve updated information when needed. Now it can handle a wider range of user queries.

To inspect all the steps your agent just took, check out this LangSmith trace.

## Next steps

The chatbot cannot remember past interactions on its own, which limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the next part, you will add **memory** to address this.

# Workflows and Agents

This guide reviews common patterns for agentic systems. In describing these systems, it can be useful to make a distinction between "workflows" and "agents". One way to think about this difference is nicely explained in Anthropic's `Building Effective Agents` blog post:

> Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
> Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

Here is a simple way to visualize these differences:

!Agent Workflow

When building agents and workflows, LangGraph offers a number of benefits including persistence, streaming, and support for debugging as well as deployment.

## Set up

You can use any chat model that supports structured outputs and tool calling. Below, we show the process of installing the packages, setting API keys, and testing structured outputs / tool calling for Anthropic.

Install dependencies

```
pip install langchain_core langchain-anthropic langgraph

```

Initialize an LLM

*API Reference: ChatAnthropic*

```
import os
import getpass

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

```

## Building Blocks: The Augmented LLM

LLM have augmentations that support building workflows and agents. These include structured outputs and tool calling, as shown in this image from the Anthropic blog on `Building Effective Agents`:

!augmented_llm.png

```
# Schema for structured output
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class SearchQuery(BaseModel):
    search_query: str = Field(None, description="Query that is optimized web search.")
    justification: str = Field(
        None, description="Why this query is relevant to the user's request."
    )

# Augment the LLM with schema for structured output
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(SearchQuery)

# Invoke the augmented LLM
output = structured_llm.invoke("How does Calcium CT score relate to high cholesterol?")

# Define a tool
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a * b

# Augment the LLM with tools
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([multiply])

# Invoke the LLM with input that triggers the tool call
msg = llm_with_tools.invoke("What is 2 times 3?")

# Get the tool call
msg.tool_calls

```

## Prompt chaining

In prompt chaining, each LLM call processes the output of the previous one.

As noted in the Anthropic blog on `Building Effective Agents`:

> Prompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. You can add programmatic checks (see "gate" in the diagram below) on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process is still on track.
>
> When to use this workflow: This workflow is ideal for situations where the task can be easily and cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks. The main goal is to trade off latency for higher accuracy, by making each LLM call an easier task.

## Parallelization

With parallelization, LLMs work simultaneously on a task:

> LLMs can sometimes work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. This workflow, parallelization, manifests in two key variations: Sectioning: Breaking a task into independent subtasks run in parallel. Voting: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse outputs.
>
> When to use this workflow: Parallelization is effective when the divided subtasks can be parallelized for speed, or when multiple perspectives or attempts are needed for higher confidence results. For complex tasks with multiple considerations, LLMs generally perform better when each consideration is handled by a separate LLM call, allowing focused attention on each specific aspect.

## Routing

Routing classifies an input and directs it to a followup task. As noted in the Anthropic blog on `Building Effective Agents`:

> Routing classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This workflow allows for separation of concerns, and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow, optimizing for one kind of input can hurt performance on other inputs.
>
> When to use this workflow: Routing works well for complex tasks where there are distinct categories that are better handled separately, and where classification can be handled accurately, either by an LLM or a more traditional classification model/algorithm.

## Orchestrator-Worker

With orchestrator-worker, an orchestrator breaks down a task and delegates each sub-task to workers. As noted in the Anthropic blog on `Building Effective Agents`:

> In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.
>
> When to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can't predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). Whereas it's topographically similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibilityâ€”subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input.

from typing import Annotated, List
import operator

# Schema for structured output to use in planning
class Section(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(

    description: str = Field(
        description="Brief overview of the main topics and concepts to be covered in this section.",

        description="Sections of the report.",
    )

# Augment the LLM with schema for structured output
planner = llm.with_structured_output(Sections)

```

**Creating Workers in LangGraph**

Because orchestrator-worker workflows are common, LangGraph **has the `Send` API to support this**. It lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send each one a specific input. Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a *shared state key* that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output. As you can see below, we iterate over a list of sections and `Send` each to a worker node. See further documentation here and here.

```
from langgraph.types import Send

# Graph state
class State(TypedDict):
    topic: str  # Report topic
    sections: list[Section]  # List of report sections
    completed_sections: Annotated[
        list, operator.add

## Evaluator-optimizer

In the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop:

> When to use this workflow: This workflow is particularly effective when we have clear evaluation criteria, and when iterative refinement provides measurable value. The two signs of good fit are, first, that LLM responses can be demonstrably improved when a human articulates their feedback; and second, that the LLM can provide such feedback. This is analogous to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through when producing a polished document.

## Agent

Agents are typically implemented as an LLM performing actions (via tool-calling) based on environmental feedback in a loop. As noted in the Anthropic blog on `Building Effective Agents`:

> Agents can handle sophisticated tasks, but their implementation is often straightforward. They are typically just LLMs using tools based on environmental feedback in a loop. It is therefore crucial to design toolsets and their documentation clearly and thoughtfully.
>
> When to use agents: Agents can be used for open-ended problems where it's difficult or impossible to predict the required number of steps, and where you can't hardcode a fixed path. The LLM will potentially operate for many turns, and you must have some level of trust in its decision-making. Agents' autonomy makes them ideal for scaling tasks in trusted environments.

# Invoke

messages = pre_built_agent.invoke({"messages": messages})
for m in messages["messages"]:
    m.pretty_print()

```

## What LangGraph provides

By constructing each of the above in LangGraph, we get a few things:

### Persistence: Human-in-the-Loop

LangGraph persistence layer supports interruption and approval of actions (e.g., Human In The Loop). See Module 3 of LangChain Academy.

### Persistence: Memory

LangGraph persistence layer supports conversational (short-term) memory and long-term memory. See Modules 2 and 5 of LangChain Academy:

### Streaming

LangGraph provides several ways to stream workflow / agent outputs or intermediate state. See Module 3 of LangChain Academy.

### Deployment

LangGraph provides an easy on-ramp for deployment, observability, and evaluation. See module 6 of LangChain Academy.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meetingâ€™s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone inÂ the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meetingâ€™s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can recordÂ andÂ transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcriptsÂ is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies toÂ recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option settingÂ will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizerâ€™s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participantâ€™s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms:Â DesktopÂ (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn onÂ [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b)Â and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)>Â **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5)Â > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stopÂ the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stopÂ the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places dependingÂ on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer'sÂ OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat orÂ channel conversationÂ (if youâ€™re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recordingÂ leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers canÂ easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

SeeÂ [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019)Â for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expirationÂ of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **editÂ permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message,Â hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip,Â click theÂ "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video.Â Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worryâ€”if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizersÂ can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note:Â Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn onÂ [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b)Â and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)>Â **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5)Â > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stopÂ the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stopÂ the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places dependingÂ on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer'sÂ OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat orÂ channel conversationÂ (if youâ€™re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recordingÂ leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers canÂ easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

SeeÂ [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019)Â for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expirationÂ of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **editÂ permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message,Â hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip,Â click theÂ "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video.Â Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worryâ€”if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizersÂ can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording**Â in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll beÂ [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chatâ€”or in the channel, if youâ€™re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meetingâ€™s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone inÂ the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meetingâ€™s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can recordÂ andÂ transcribe**.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note:Â Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ 

â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note:Â If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note:Â Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meetingâ€™s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone inÂ the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meetingâ€™s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can recordÂ andÂ transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcriptsÂ is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies toÂ recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option settingÂ will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizerâ€™s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participantâ€™s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms:Â DesktopÂ (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

There are three options for who can record and transcribe a meeting:

* Organizers and co-organizers
* Organizers, co-organizers and presenters
* No one

For info about organizer and presenter roles, see [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019).

**Notes:**

* Teams live transcripts for meetings with recording and/or transcription are stored in the meeting organizer's OneDrive for Business. The transcript can be accessed through the meeting chat and **Recap** tab in Teams until a meeting organizer deletes the transcript.
* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

During a Teams meeting, you can start a live transcription that captures everything being said. The text appears alongside the meeting video or audio in real time, including the speaker's name and time stamp.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn onÂ [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b)Â and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)>Â **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5)Â > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stopÂ the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stopÂ the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places dependingÂ on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer'sÂ OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat orÂ channel conversationÂ (if youâ€™re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recordingÂ leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers canÂ easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

SeeÂ [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019)Â for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expirationÂ of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **editÂ permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message,Â hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip,Â click theÂ "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video.Â Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worryâ€”if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizersÂ can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording**Â in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll beÂ [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chatâ€”or in the channel, if youâ€™re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note:Â Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ 

â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note:Â If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meetingâ€™s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone inÂ the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meetingâ€™s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can recordÂ andÂ transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcriptsÂ is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies toÂ recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option settingÂ will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizerâ€™s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participantâ€™s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms:Â DesktopÂ (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn onÂ [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b)Â and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)>Â **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5)Â > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stopÂ the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stopÂ the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places dependingÂ on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer'sÂ OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat orÂ channel conversationÂ (if youâ€™re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recordingÂ leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers canÂ easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

SeeÂ [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019)Â for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

To choose who can record and transcribe:

3. InÂ **Event**, selectÂ **Meeting options**Â  ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e).

6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expirationÂ of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **editÂ permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message,Â hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip,Â click theÂ "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video.Â Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worryâ€”if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizersÂ can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording**Â in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll beÂ [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chatâ€”or in the channel, if youâ€™re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

CONTENT:
As the folks who build Teams, we spend a lot of time learning about how you work and building a product to help.

So, in thisÂ series, *Teams tips from the experts*, we're going to share how we use Teams. Think of it as aÂ productivity guide full of tips and tricks for using Microsoft Teams at work. And we won't just be sharing glory stories and great gifs (although there are plenty of great gifs) â€” we'll talk about where we got stuck, too, and how we got past it.

Hopefully, our experiences can help you find ways that Teams can complement your work.

> Different teams use Teams differently, but on the Teams team (say that five times fast), this is how we do it.

But keep in mind that, like a hammer or a computer chip, Teams is a tool. The way our team uses it to build Teams may not be the same way another team would use it to run a hospital or bank. Itâ€™s probably not even the same way another group of people would build great productivity software. And that's OK.

Different teams use Teams differently, but on the Teams team (say that five times fast), this is how we do it.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note:Â Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Desktop
Mobile
Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ 

â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note:Â If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Select Video effects.

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed.

Select Add new  to upload and use an image from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

Select Preview to view the background before you apply it.

Select Apply.

Notes:Â 

Linux users aren't able to use this feature.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

Each image comes with a brief description, allowing you to learn more about the location or subject featured in the photo. The Bing Wallpaper app is easy to install and use, providing a seamless way to keep your desktop visually engaging and informative.Â

* **Everyone**: Everyone inÂ the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meetingâ€™s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can recordÂ andÂ transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcriptsÂ is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies toÂ recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option settingÂ will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizerâ€™s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participantâ€™s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms:Â DesktopÂ (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)>Â **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5)Â > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places dependingÂ on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer'sÂ OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat orÂ channel conversationÂ (if youâ€™re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recordingÂ leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers canÂ easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expirationÂ of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **editÂ permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message,Â hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip,Â click theÂ "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video.Â Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worryâ€”if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizersÂ can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording**Â in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll beÂ [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chatâ€”or in the channel, if youâ€™re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

Linux users aren't able to use this feature.

Background effects aren't available if you're using Teams through optimized virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

Select Generate more for more choices. You can also select a different theme before generating more. Your previously generated option will still remain available.

Select Apply and turn on video to apply a background.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn onÂ [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b)Â and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)>Â **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5)Â > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stopÂ the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stopÂ the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places dependingÂ on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer'sÂ OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat orÂ channel conversationÂ (if youâ€™re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recordingÂ leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers canÂ easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

SeeÂ [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019)Â for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expirationÂ of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **editÂ permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message,Â hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip,Â click theÂ "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video.Â Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worryâ€”if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizersÂ can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording**Â in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll beÂ [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chatâ€”or in the channel, if youâ€™re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meetingâ€™s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone inÂ the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meetingâ€™s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can recordÂ andÂ transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcriptsÂ is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies toÂ recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option settingÂ will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizerâ€™s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participantâ€™s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms:Â DesktopÂ (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

* If you are using Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to join Teams meetings, please contact your CVI provider to ensure that your CVI participants get the transcription notification when transcription starts.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note:Â Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

Change your background
Before a meeting

Go to your Teams calendar.

Select a meeting and select Join.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ 

â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Note:Â If you don't see this option in the menu, the feature might not be available on your device.

During a meeting

Join a Teams meeting.

In your meeting controls, select More actions  > Video effects and settings .

Use AI to decorate your background in a meeting

Take advantage of the new AI-generated Decorate effect in Teams to further personalize your backgrounds. There are five options to choose from:

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Once you've chosen a theme, select Generate to preview options.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn onÂ [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b)Â and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)>Â **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5)Â > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stopÂ the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stopÂ the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places dependingÂ on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer'sÂ OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat orÂ channel conversationÂ (if youâ€™re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recordingÂ leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers canÂ easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

SeeÂ [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019)Â for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

To choose who can record and transcribe:

2. Select an event and selectÂ **Edit** ![Edit icon](/images/en-us/073d9d9a-0d84-402f-acdb-5765e790261f)>Â **More options**.
3. InÂ **Event**, selectÂ **Meeting options**Â  ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e).
4. In **Recording and transcription** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹, choose your preference in the **Who can record and transcribe** dropdown menu.
5. Select **Apply**.

3. SelectÂ **Edit**.
4. In the meeting description, press and holdÂ **Ctrl**and selectÂ **Meeting options**.
5. In **Recording and transcription** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹, choose your preference in the **Who can record and transcribe** dropdown menu.
6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expirationÂ of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **editÂ permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message,Â hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip,Â click theÂ "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video.Â Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worryâ€”if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizersÂ can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording**Â in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll beÂ [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chatâ€”or in the channel, if youâ€™re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meetingâ€™s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone inÂ the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meetingâ€™s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can recordÂ andÂ transcribe**.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note:Â Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meetingâ€™s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone inÂ the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meetingâ€™s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can recordÂ andÂ transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcriptsÂ is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies toÂ recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option settingÂ will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizerâ€™s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participantâ€™s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms:Â DesktopÂ (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn onÂ [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b)Â and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)>Â **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5)Â > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stopÂ the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stopÂ the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places dependingÂ on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer'sÂ OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat orÂ channel conversationÂ (if youâ€™re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recordingÂ leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers canÂ easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

SeeÂ [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019)Â for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

To choose who can record and transcribe:

3. InÂ **Event**, selectÂ **Meeting options**Â  ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e).

6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expirationÂ of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **editÂ permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message,Â hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip,Â click theÂ "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video.Â Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worryâ€”if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizersÂ can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording**Â in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll beÂ [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chatâ€”or in the channel, if youâ€™re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn onÂ [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b)Â and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)>Â **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5)Â > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stopÂ the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stopÂ the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places dependingÂ on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer'sÂ OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat orÂ channel conversationÂ (if youâ€™re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recordingÂ leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers canÂ easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

SeeÂ [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019)Â for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

To choose who can record and transcribe:

6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expirationÂ of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **editÂ permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message,Â hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip,Â click theÂ "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video.Â Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worryâ€”if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizersÂ can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording**Â in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll beÂ [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chatâ€”or in the channel, if youâ€™re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

### Where is my recording?

If you canâ€™t find a recording:

* Check if there is a message indicating that your recording started. If you donâ€™t see this message, the recording most likely didnâ€™t start and canâ€™t be recovered.

Change your background in Microsoft Teams meetings

Keep your background private during Teams meetings by blurring or changing your background. Upload your own images, or choose from background images already in Teams.

In Teams Premium, apply branded logos or images to your background.

Note:Â Blurring or replacing your background may not prevent sensitive information from being visible to other people in the call or meeting.

From the pre-join screen, select Video effects .

To blur your background, select the dropdown arrow next to Blur and choose Standard blur or Portrait blur.

â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Select a Teams background to apply it to your video feed, or upload and apply your own.

To use an image of your own, select More video effects > Add new  and then select one to upload from your computer. Make sure it's a .JPG, .PNG, or .BMP file.

To turn off background effects, select None . Your background will persist in all your meetings and calls until you change it again.

Clean up: Tidies up your surroundings, removing clutter and creating a more streamlined and minimalistic aesthetic.

Fancy: Incorporates lavish and elegant decorative elements, like wallpaper, candles, and chandeliers.

Greenhouse: Adds plants and greenery into your space.

Celebration: Includes festive decorations like balloons, streamers, and lighting.

Surprise me: Cycles through a variety of styles and themes to transform your space, including 2D animation, underwater, a block-style design reminiscent of Minecraft, and a space shuttle theme.

To turn on this feature, follow the same steps as noted above to change your background either before or during the meeting.

Once in the video effects menu, select Decorate.

If your camera is currently on, it'll turn off while you choose a new background. Select Start when prompted to turn off the camera and see your options.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meetingâ€™s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone inÂ the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meetingâ€™s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can recordÂ andÂ transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcriptsÂ is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies toÂ recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option settingÂ will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizerâ€™s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participantâ€™s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms:Â DesktopÂ (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn onÂ [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b)Â and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)>Â **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5)Â > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stopÂ the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stopÂ the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places dependingÂ on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer'sÂ OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat orÂ channel conversationÂ (if youâ€™re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recordingÂ leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

## Choose who can record and transcribe

With [Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52), meeting organizers canÂ easily manage who can record when scheduling Teams meetings. There are two options for who can record a meeting: organizers and co-organizers, or organizers and presenters.

SeeÂ [Roles in a Teams meeting](/en-us/office/roles-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c16fa7d0-1666-4dde-8686-0a0bfe16e019)Â for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.

To choose who can record and transcribe:

6. Select **Save**.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expirationÂ of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **editÂ permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message,Â hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip,Â click theÂ "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video.Â Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worryâ€”if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizersÂ can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording**Â in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll beÂ [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chatâ€”or in the channel, if youâ€™re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

Customize who can access a recording or transcript in Microsoft Teams

As a meeting organizer, you can choose who has access to your meetingâ€™s recording, AI recap, and transcript. Select from three options: (1) Everyone, (2) Organizers and co-organizers, or (3) Specific people.

* **Everyone**: Everyone inÂ the meeting can access.
* **Organizers and co-organizers**: Only the people who organized the meeting can access.
* **Specific people**: In addition to the organizer(s), presenters you choose can also access.

By default, access is set to **Everyone**, but you can change this before the meeting starts. If you or another organizer changes this meeting option during the meeting, you will need to end and restart the meeting for the change to take effect.

**Note:**Copilot will not be available to meeting attendees excluded from access to the recording or transcript, even if **Allow Copilot** is set to **Only during the meeting**.

To customize access to your meetingâ€™s recording or transcript:

1. Go to **Meeting options** from any of the meeting option entry points.

   **Tip:**Meeting options will open in a new window on your default browser. For the best experience, use Edge to open all meeting options.
2. Select **Recording & transcription** from the options on the left.
3. Select an option from the dropdown next to **Who can recordÂ andÂ transcribe**.

**Notes:**

* This meeting option is only available with a Copilot license or Teams Premium license.
* Customizing access to meeting recordings or transcriptsÂ is not available for channel meetings or ad hoc meetings.
* This meeting option only applies toÂ recordings, transcripts, AI recaps, and transcript-based Copilot access. If you or someone else changes the permissions through SharePoint, sensitivity labels, or other methods or if you share the link to the meeting recording, the original meeting option settingÂ will not apply.
* This meeting option will be available to organizers and co-organizers if the recording storage policy directs recordings to the organizerâ€™s OneDrive for Business (ODB). If set to store in the participantâ€™s OneDrive, this meeting option will not appear.
* This meeting option can be changed by the meeting organizer on the following platforms:Â DesktopÂ (Windows and Mac), Mobile (iOS and Android).
* Third party apps will continue to have access and are not restricted by this new meeting option. The meeting organizer can manage third party app access to the meeting.

[Set up live translated captions](#setuptranslatedcaptions)

## Live câ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹aptions in Teams

Teams can detect whatâ€™s said in a meeting and present real-time captions. If you're using the desktop app for Windows or Mac, there are also several caption customization options.

**Notes:**

* People can choose not to be identified in captions. For details, see [Hide your identity in meeting captions and transcripts](/en-us/office/hide-your-identity-in-meeting-captions-and-transcripts-in-microsoft-teams-a1095e1a-a2f0-453e-8101-eca76429ff04).
* Teams doesn't save captions. If you'd like a transcript of the meeting, turn on transcription. You'll be able to download the transcript after the meeting.

There are a couple ways to get live captions in Teams:

* From the built-in captioning provided by Teams
* From a Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART) captioner. To learn how to use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting, refer to [Use CART captions in a Microsoft Teams meeting (human generated captions)](/en-us/office/use-cart-captions-in-a-microsoft-teams-meeting-human-generated-captions-2dd889e8-32a8-4582-98b8-6c96cf14eb47).

## Live caption settings

Teams has built-in closed captioning you can turn on from the meeting controls.

### Turn captions on and off

* To use live captions in a meeting, go to your meeting controls at the top of the screen and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Show live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).
* To stop using live captions, go to your meeting controls and select **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Language and speech** ![Language and speech menu item icon](/images/en-us/16b5b37d-9bd8-4693-8fa8-8daa6c0b9066) > **Hide live captions** ![Closed caption menu icon](/images/en-us/9f04b559-6991-4563-b1a9-ce6277c01f83).

### Change the spoken language

Set a meetingâ€™s spoken language to the language people are speaking for more accurate captions.

If people are speaking a different language than the meetingâ€™s set spoken language, Teams will detect the language mismatch. Then, the meeting organizer, co-organizer, transcript initiator, or initiator of the feature that turned on transcription, will be prompted to update the spoken language:

* Select **Settings** to update the meeting spoken language manually.
* Select **Yes, change it** to immediately update to the detected meeting spoken language.

![Screenshot of a Teams notification prompting to update a meeting's spoken language.](/images/en-us/9a71b2d7-9d11-4e99-93a6-77fa189f44a3)

The meeting organizer, co-organizer(s), transcript initiator, or initiator of any feature that turned on transcription, can access the meeting spoken language at any time.

To access the meeting spoken language settings:

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
2. In the **Meeting spoken language** dropdown menu, select the language everyone is speaking from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Update** to change.

**Important:**For other participants to access the meeting spoken language, transcription must be turned off. If thereâ€™s an ongoing transcription, they must first turn it off or turn off the feature that started the transcription. Then, they must manually turn transcription on again.

## Set up live translated captions in an event

In town halls and live events, organizers preselect which languages attendees can see live captions in. Organizers can select six languages, or ten if they have Premium, from over 50 different languages.

### To set up live translated captions in an event:

1. Open the event in your Teams calendar.
2. In **Details**, select **Meeting options** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e).
3. InÂ **Engagement**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Â  ![Teams Chat Tab icon](/images/en-us/3c2a24f3-7e8f-4419-8c78-16c5a795d45f)Â >Â **Translate attendee captions**, select the languages that live translated captions will be available in during your event.  
     
   ![Meeting option showing how to add languages for live translated captions in an event.](/images/en-us/7249ee23-9636-4844-b2a0-f0dae56359f7)
4. Select **Apply**.

Attendees can see live translated captions in only one of the languages you preselected.

## Use live translated captions

By default, live captions are shown in the language used during the meeting or event. Live translated captions allow users to see captions translated into the language theyâ€™re most comfortable with.

**Note:**Live translated captions in meetings are only available as part of Teams Premium, an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to Teams Premium, contact your IT admin.

### To use live translated captions:

1. Turn on live captions in your meeting.
2. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Language settings** ![Language settings in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/985bfe5d-a728-46a4-a9f1-a02b2d0826ff).
3. Make sure **Meeting spoken language** is correct.
4. Turn on the **Translate to** toggle.
5. In the dropdown menu, select the language you want your captions translated to.

### Customize captions

If you're using the desktop app on Windows or Mac, you can customize the font size and color, increase the number of lines displayed, and change the positioning of the captions in the meeting window.

1. To the right of captions, select **Caption settings** ![Settings button](/images/en-us/fe3fb52d-f1db-49e6-88cf-7d1ec1e8022e) > **Caption styles** ![Color icon in Microsoft Teams](/images/en-us/8fdf1401-2b5e-4511-81a1-83c9e4e2f20f).
2. Choose the color, position, and style you want to see your captions in.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

### Get the most out of your captions

To make sure your live captions are as accurate as possible, try these best practices:

* Speak clearly, slowly, and directly into the mic. As your distance from the mic increases, captions may become less accurate.
* Avoid locations with background noise.
* Avoid having multiple people speak at the same time.
* Use the highest-quality Teams-certified equipment available to you.

**Note:**Obscenities are obscured by asterisks.

### FAQ

#### Where does Teams process the data it uses to provide live captions?

We process the data in the geographical region where your organization is based.

#### What data does Teams use to create the captions?

The Microsoft Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology service, which generates Teams meeting captions, may use a meeting's subject, invitation, participant names, attachments, and recent emails of the participants to improve the accuracy of captions.

#### How does Teams translate live captions?

We use the Microsoft Speech Translation technology powered by Azure Cognitive Services for translating live captions.

#### Who has access to this data?

No one. Microsoft ASR involves no human intervention, and no one can access the meeting audio or any other meeting information at any time.

#### Does Teams store any caption data?

No. Caption data is permanently deleted after the meeting is over.

#### If I don't want Teams to process this data to begin with, can I prevent it?

Yes. Simply don't turn on live captions. Your admin can also disable the feature altogether. Go herefor more info about how to do that.

**Important:**Microsoft reserves the right to restrict transcription and translation services, with reasonable notice, in order to limit excessive use and/or fraud, and to maintain service performance. These services include live captions, subtitles, and transcription functionality available across Office 365 products like Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint, Stream, and others.

Teams can detect what's said in a meeting or group call and present real-time captions.

**Note:**Captions aren't yet available in government clouds on the Teams mobile app.

## FAQ

### Why is my meeting recording automatically if I didnâ€™t schedule it that way?

* If you schedule a meeting or event using the town hall or webinar template, automatic recording and transcription will be on by default.Â   
    
  To turn off automatic recording before the meeting or event starts, open the event details in your Teams calendar and select **Meeting options**Â  ![Settings icon](/images/en-us/e2a1f329-d95b-7d5e-181c-7c3e12fd9321) > **Recording & transcription** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

* If you have a compliance recording policy, recording will start automatically every time you join a meeting. This recording will be stored in your orgâ€™s storage and not your personal OneDrive or Microsoft SharePoint.  
    
  To learn more, see Third-party compliance recording for Teams calls and meetings.

### Where are recordings and transcripts saved?

To learn more, seeÂ [Interpreter in Microsoft Teams meetings](/en-us/office/interpreter-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-c7efe2bb-535d-42ab-a5c4-d2d91619b46d#bkmk_multilingual_recognition). |

### What happens if the meeting organizer is a shared mailbox?

### Where is my recording?

If you canâ€™t find a recording:

* Check if there is a message indicating that your recording started. If you donâ€™t see this message, the recording most likely didnâ€™t start and canâ€™t be recovered.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a recording start notification.](/images/en-us/dc21305a-252b-4f92-8b1a-e733b250e474)
* If you know the recording was started but canâ€™t find it in OneDrive, check if it was deleted, moved to a different location, or expired. Look in your recycle bin and second stage recycle bin.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a file recycle bin highlighting where to find the second stage recycle bin.](/images/en-us/90900c77-8b4c-4c28-a09c-5538d6301610)
* If you canâ€™t find your recording in OneDrive but see this recording chiclet in your chat history, your recording failed to upload to OneDrive and will be stored in a temporary storage for 21 days. You can retry uploading it to OneDrive or download it to your local device.  
    
  ![Screenshot of a recording chiclet that indicated the recording upload failed.](/images/en-us/e2fbb734-95a5-464a-9a35-a3afd9245f14)

## Start recording

In a Teams meeting, one person can record at a time. When you start recording a meeting, everyone will be notified automatically. You can also turn onÂ [live transcriptions](/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b)Â and view them during the meeting.

To start a meeting recording:

1. Start or join the meeting.
2. In your meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![Microsoft Teams more options icon](/images/en-us/cd070cfd-ed96-4162-8b99-a4f89bb3226c)> **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e)>Â **Start recording** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).

**Notes:**Meeting recordings won't capture:

* More than four peoples' video streams at once
* Whiteboards and annotations
* Shared notes
* Content shared by apps
* Videos or animations embedded in PowerPoint Live presentations

## Stop recording

1. In the meeting controls, selectÂ **More actions** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5)Â > **Record and transcribe** ![Record and transcribe icon](/images/en-us/225d74a7-b38f-4e2e-a237-c6bfb5242a5e).
2. Choose one of the following:

   * **Stop recording** to stopÂ the recording and live transcription.
   * **Stop transcription** to stopÂ the live transcription only. The recording will continue until you select **Stop recording**.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.

## Find recordings

Recordings are available in different places dependingÂ on the type of meeting.

* The recording is processed and saved in the meeting organizer'sÂ OneDrive for Business.
* The meeting recording shows up in the meeting chat orÂ channel conversationÂ (if youâ€™re meeting in a channel).

**Note:**For now, guests and external attendees can view the recording only if it's explicitly shared with them.

## Who can start or stop a recording?

Anyone who meets the following criteria can start or stop a recording if the meeting organizer has their cloud recording policy setting turned on:

* Has one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* Has recording enabled by an IT admin.
* Isn't a guest or from another organization.

The organizer doesn't need to be present.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

| Type of user | Can start recording? | Can stop recording? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meeting organizer | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from same org | * Yes | * Yes |
| Person from another org or company | * No | * No |
| Guest | * No | * No |
| Anonymous | * No | * No |

**Notes:**

* Recording continues even if the person who started the recordingÂ leaves the meeting.
* The recording stops automatically once everyone leaves the meeting. If someone forgets to leave, the recording will end and automatically restart every four hours until the last participant leaves the meeting.
* If one of the participants has a policy for compliance recording, the meeting will be recorded according to the policy even if that participant is from another org.

**Note:**
[Teams Premium](/en-us/office/overview-of-microsoft-teams-premium-4b34cd18-fa16-4797-bae0-b96b13a54f52) is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more personalized, intelligent, and secure. To get access to this license, contact your IT admin.

## Manage the expirationÂ of a meeting recording

Your admin settings determine a recording's expiration. To change the expiration of a meeting recording:

**Important:**You must have **editÂ permission** for the recording to change the expiration date. Generally speaking, the meeting organizer and co-organizers are automatically granted edit permission.

1. Find the recording in the meeting chat, then open the recording in Stream.

   1. For the recap message,Â hover over "**Set to expire**" beneath the recording thumbnail. In the popout tooltip,Â click theÂ "**View or change**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recap Chiclet](/images/en-us/19643bb6-2269-4705-876a-bf38b7cf2d6d)
   2. For the recording message, click the "**here**" link to open the recording in Stream.![Expiration Recording Chiclet](/images/en-us/bf402289-a7e2-40ce-ba85-31c7ea36589a)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
2. On the Stream page, select the expiration countdown beneath the video.Â Change the expiration by selecting a timeframe from the dropdown menu. You can also choose **Remove expiration** if you don't want it to be deleted.  
   ![Recording expiration time menu](/images/en-us/844bc5ed-db91-4d73-a000-0a55359e23d8)â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

**Notes:**

* The message indicating that your recording will expire will persist on the recording in the chat even if you remove the expiration date. But don't worryâ€”if you've selected **No expiration**, it won't expire.
* The owner of the recording will get an email when it expires. At that point, they'll have up to 90 days to recover it from the recycle bin. Once recovered, the recording will no longer expire automatically.
* Watching the recording won't affect the expiration date.
* More info for admins can be found here.

## Privacy

All meeting participants will receive a notification in their Teams desktop, web, or mobile app as soon as a meeting recording starts.

Depending on your region, you may need everyone's permission before you can record them. For more information, see the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The meeting organizer automatically owns the recording. By default, only meeting organizers and co-organizersÂ can download or delete the recording.

| Type of recording | Permission to view | Permission to download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel meeting | Team | User with view permission |
| Private meeting | Invited and attended users (chat members) | User with view permission |
| Group call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one call | Chat members | User with view permission |
| One-to-one PSTN call | Teams user | Teams user |

## Troubleshoot recordings

If you're having problems recording a meeting, you'll probably need the help of an IT admin to work through them. Keep these things in mind as you move forward:

* Both the meeting organizer and recorder must have one of the following licenses:Â Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Premium, or Business Essentials.
* An IT admin must provide a recording license to both the meeting organizer and the recorder.
* Guests can't record meetings. Federated users can record calls, but not meetings.

Start, stop, and view meeting recordings in Teams mobile app.

For the best meeting recording and video experiences, download the latest version of Teams on your mobile device.â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹

## Start a meeting recording

To start recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Start recording**Â in the meeting controls.

Everyone in the meeting will be notified that recording has started.

## Stop a meeting recording

To stop recording, selectÂ **More options** ![More options button](/images/en-us/d6c70643-162c-4414-954a-9bcb33ee4bc5) > **Stop recording**â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ in the meeting controls.

The recording will be processed and saved to Microsoft Stream. Then, it'll beÂ [ready to play](/en-us/office/play-share-and-download-a-meeting-recording-in-microsoft-teams-7d7e5dc5-9ae4-4b94-8589-27496037e8fa).

## View a meeting recording

Meeting recording will appear up in the meeting chatâ€”or in the channel, if youâ€™re meeting in a channel.

You can also find a meeting recording by opening the past meeting's details in your Teams calendar.

**Important:**

* Teams meeting recordings are no longer saved to Microsoft Stream. All recordings are now saved to OneDrive for Business.
* If your organization still uses Stream, please note:

* After a recording stops, it's processed and saved toÂ Stream. Then,Â it'sÂ ready to play.
* When a recording is available, the meeting organizer will receive an email. The recording willÂ appear in the meeting chat or channel.
* If an admin has set a company policy for saving to Stream, accept it beforeÂ recording.
