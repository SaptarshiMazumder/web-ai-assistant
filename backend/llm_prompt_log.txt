* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.
* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

Testimonials collected from actual satisfied T-Mobile Home Internet customers.

* ### What is T-Mobile 5G Home Internet?

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + The T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™  plans have our 5-year price guarantee so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes (exclusions like taxes and fees apply).
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How fast is 5G home internet (in Mbps) compared to cable?

  T-Mobile All-In or Amplified Home Internet customers delivering typical speeds between 134 mbps – 415 mbps. Typical upload speeds are between 12 – 55 Mbps. 25% of our customers see speeds below and 25% see speeds above these ranges.

  Keep in mind that speeds can vary depending on location, time of day, signal strength and availability, and other factors. Click here for more info.

Best of all, you have nothing to lose, since you can try out T-Mobile Home Internet first to make sure you find a plan that works for you.
* ### Do these plans come with 5-Year price guarantee?

  Yes, new and upgrading customers on the T-Mobile Rely Internet, T-Mobile Amplified Internet, T-Mobile All-In Internet and AWAY™ plans are covered by our 5- year price guarantee. 5-year price guarantee means that we won't change the price of fixed-wireless 5G internet data for at least 5 years while you are on an eligible plan. Taxes & fees, voluntary equipment or speed upgrades, future wireless generations, select limited-time promotions, per-use charges, third-party services, and network management practices aren't included.

* ### What is T-Mobile Fiber internet?

  We have plans offering speeds from 300 Mbps up to 2 Gigs (2000 Mbps) in select locations throughout the United States (speeds vary by location). Our service offers the same upload and download speeds for consistently fast speeds in both directions.

  With fiber internet you also get significantly more uploading power than with most cable internet options. Upload speeds are critical for households with multiple people and devices using the internet simultaneously for a wide range of tasks, including:

  + Video conferencing
  + Gaming
  + Sharing large files
  + Livestreaming.
* ### Which internet technology is best for me??

  It really depends on your needs - both Fiber and 5G offer fast, reliable internet with unique advantages. Fiber offers the power to take your internet experience to the gigabit level, unlocking ultra high performance for households of avid gamers, remote workers or families who just want the best of streaming and reliability. On the other hand, 5G is perfect for those who value flexibility and ease of installation.

  + It’s affordable internet service with national availability that lets you do it all with taxes and fees included for qualified accounts, no annual contract, and no equipment fees.
  + T-Mobile Internet service is powered by America’s largest 5G network in locations we determine will receive a great internet experience.
  + You receive service through a 5G Gateway device (which combines the capabilities of a router and a modem), the Gateway device then converts the 5G signal to Wi-Fi, and provides a Wi-Fi signal.
  + All of our plans are price locked so you won’t have to worry about exploding bills and price hikes.
  + Go from box to browsing in 15 minutes or less with an easy, self-installation process.
* ### How does installation work?

  T-Mobile Fiber internet installation involves running a fiber-optic cable from the nearest fiber connection point (like a street node) to your home. Technicians will either bury the cable underground or attach it to utility poles. Once the cable reaches your home, they install an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) inside, which converts the fiber signal into one that your devices can use. Then, the ONT is connected to a router, which distributes the internet to your home via Wi-Fi or wired connections. The technician will test the connection to ensure everything works, and once activated, you're ready to enjoy fast, reliable fiber internet.

  T-Mobile 5G internet installation is much simpler than fiber internet installation. Here's how it generally works:

  1. Set Up the Gateway: Once you receive the device, you’ll plug it into a power outlet and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network. The gateway needs to be placed near a window or in a location with a good 5G signal for the best performance.
  2. Activation: After plugging it in, you’ll follow the setup instructions, either on a mobile app or through a web interface, to activate the service. This process typically takes just a few minutes.
  3. Start Using the Service: Once activated, the 5G Home Internet Gateway provides high-speed 5G internet to your home, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, depending on your setup.

   No need for technicians to come to your house for installation—it's a self-installation process, making it quick and easy to get started with 5G internet.
* ### What is the difference between Fiber and Cable internet?

  Fiber offers faster speeds, higher reliability, and greater bandwidth than cable, which uses electrical signals over coaxial cables. Fiber is less prone to interference and can deliver speeds up to 25x faster, especially for uploads. Cable, however, can experience slower speeds during peak usage times due to network congestion.
* ### Will I be charged for installation?

  Nope! T-Mobile Fiber Installation is included in the cost of your plan. T-Mobile 5G Internet just requires a simple 15‑minute self‑install.
* ### WIll T-Mobile help pay my early termination fee if I switch?

  T-Mobile 5G home internet

  We’ve made it easier than ever for customers stuck in a contract or bundle to make the switch to T-Mobile Internet! When new and existing customers make the move to T-Mobile Internet from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), we'll pay off your previous carrier’s service contracts and early termination fee (ETF) up to $500. There has never been a better time to break up with your ISP!

  T-Mobile Fiber Internet

  We’ll cover your early termination fee—up to $750 via virtual prepaid card to you—when you switch to T-Mobile Fiber. Submit your claim to RCSolutions@T-MobileSupport.com.

  The service is available in select areas based on T-Mobile's current wireless network. It may not be available in your area yet, but as we expand T-Mobile Home Internet, we'll prioritize areas with the highest demand.
